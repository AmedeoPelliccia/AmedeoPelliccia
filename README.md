I am a researcher moved by genuine desire to originate something powerful.

By day I work as an aerospace engineer specializing in aircraft technical data structures and publications — S1000D, ATA iSpec 2200, CSDB architecture, the kind of documentation engineering that sits between what an aircraft *is* and what operators, maintainers and regulators *need to know about it*.

What I am building here goes beyond aerospace. It is an integrating model — inclusive by design, European in origin, exportable by structure.

### IDEAL-ESG.eu — European Intelligence Foundation

**IDEAL** is both an acronym and a commitment. It names the pillars of an integrated framework for sovereign European capability:

<table>

</table>

**ESG** is not a label — it is the structural guarantee that every IDEAL pillar operates under:

| | Principle | How it is encoded |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| **E** | **Environment** | LC14 circularity, Digital Product Passports, climate impact functions, zero-emission propulsion, lifecycle traceability |
| **S** | **Social responsibility** | Fair attribution (C1–C6 taxonomy), governed recognition of third parties, open publication, Teknia Token incentives proportional to contribution |
| **G** | **Governance** | Deterministic pipelines (PATH → MTL), intent-lock layers (DWGE), acceptance gates, hash-chained ledgers, monotonic safety property, sovereign design authority |

The IDEAL pillars define *what* we build. ESG defines *how* we build it. The combination is an inclusive, integrating model — designed in Europe, structured for export.

### Two Domains — The Aerospace Pillar

Here on GitHub I collapse the **A** pillar into two owned domains, each redirecting to its alter-repository:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### ✈️ [aircraftmodel.eu](https://aircraftmodel.eu)

**→** [`Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel`](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel)

Aviation decarbonization · Hydrogen-electric propulsion · Blended wing body airframes · Certification-grade digital baselines

The **AMPEL360 Q100** lives here — a ~100-passenger regional BWB aircraft concept with H₂ PEM fuel cells, distributed propulsion, and a full OPT-IN Framework scaffold across 79 ATA chapters.

This is aircraft-level truth: structures, systems, operations, circularity.

**IDEAL pillars touched:** A (primary), E (LH₂ propulsion), L (supply chain / DPP), I (S1000D / CSDB)

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### 🛰️ [aerospacemodel.com](https://aerospacemodel.com)

**→** [`Amedeopelliccia/aerospacemodel`](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aerospacemodel)

Space-quantum infrastructure · Manufacturing technology layers · AQUA-V programme · GAIA constellation systems · GAIA-AIR / QAOS

Where the aircraft domain ends, the space and quantum domain begins. Orbital logistics, quantum-classical bridge architectures, synthetic data validation, the manufacturing pipeline that connects design to material reality, and the **GAIA-AIR** ecosystem with its Quantum Aerospace Operating System (**QAOS**) — where NBT gates bridge classical telemetry into quantum-augmented structural analysis, digital twins, and predictive maintenance.

**IDEAL pillars touched:** A (primary), I (quantum-classical data, NBT substrate), D (dual-use awareness), L (manufacturing pipelines)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

The two domains share a strict governance boundary defined in the [IDEALEeu Domain Bifurcation Charter](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel): aircraftmodel.eu handles aviation decarbonization; aerospacemodel.com handles space-quantum infrastructure. The frameworks below are the common spine that both domains inherit.

---

### The IDEAL-ESG Pillar Map

Every pillar connects to concrete engineering artefacts:

| Pillar | Primary domain | Key frameworks | Active programmes |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **I — Information** | Both | OPT-IN (5-axis), DWGE (intent-lock), S1000D/CSDB, ATA 46/95/96/97, NBT gates | Digital twin control loop, CAOS dashboards, QSN inference |
| **D — Defense** | aerospacemodel.com | Export control review (`§3.1b` §5.2), dual-use screening, secure provenance | EU Reg. 2021/821 compliance gates |
| **E — Energy** | aircraftmodel.eu | ATA 28 (LH₂ fuel), ATA 24 (electrical power), I-axis (H₂ GSE/supply chain) | AMPEL360 Q100 propulsion, TLAR energy balance |
| **A — Aerospace** | Both | AMPEL360 Q100 (aircraft), GAIA-AIR/QAOS (space), AQUA-V (orbital), NeuronBit simplicial substrate | TLAR baseline, MTL manufacturing layers, simplicial telemetry |
| **L — Logistics** | Both | LC09 (production), LC14 (circularity), DPP, TEKNIA ledger | Supply chain traceability, end-of-life management |

| ESG | Enforcement mechanism | `§STD` reference |
|-----|----------------------|------------------|
| **E — Environment** | LC14_RETIREMENT_CIRCULARITY, ATA 96 DPP, climate impact TLAR node | GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE (DPP links) |
| **S — Social** | C1–C6 contribution taxonomy, TT effort+impact formula, recognition statements | `§3.1b` CLL, GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED |
| **G — Governance** | PATH → MTL pipeline, DWGE confirmation policy, MSP, Q-criterion, INV-001–003 | `§STD`, `§3.1a`, acceptance gates |

---

### What I'm Building

The common engineering spine across all IDEAL pillars:

**OPT-IN Framework** — a 5-axis topology (**O**rganizations, **P**rograms, **T**echnologies, **I**nfrastructures, **N**eural Networks) that organizes every artefact, every uncertainty, and every incentive in a programme into a single navigable structure. The **N-axis** is operationally defined by **NBT gates** — Neural Network Bridging and Tunneling connections that link classical computer interface outputs with quantum-augmented complex manifestations.

**PATH → MTL** — a traceable pipeline (**P**rompting → **A**pproved → **T**emplate → **H**eading → **T**o **M**odel → **T**EKNIA **L**edger) that governs how artefacts are produced, accepted, registered, and rewarded. Every piece of engineering evidence — whether created by a human analyst or an AI operator — follows the same pipeline.

**DWGE** — a Deterministic Widget Generator Engine that sits in front of PATH → MTL, normalizing raw prompts into locked intents before any procedure executes. The LLM proposes; the deterministic kernel disposes. Nothing enters the model baseline without passing acceptance gates.

**Teknia Tokens (TT)** — an incentive layer where contributors are rewarded for reducing uncertainty. The formula is simple: effort + impact, weighted and hash-chained. You close a KNOT, you earn TT. The ledger is the evidence, the incentive, and the audit trail in one structure.

**NBT Gates (Neural Network Bridging and Tunneling)** — the operational definition of the N-axis. NBT gates are the connections that link classical computer interface outputs — the deterministic artefacts produced by DWGE and registered through PATH → MTL — with quantum-augmented complex manifestations: simplicial state spaces, persistent homology computations, and higher-order topological inference executed on quantum processing units. Where DWGE freezes semantic state, NBT gates freeze topological state. Where PATH → MTL projects intent onto admissible trajectories in the classical domain, NBT gates bridge that projection into quantum-accelerated manifolds and tunnel results back as geometrically structured evidence. The gate layer is realized through Quantum Simplicial Neural Networks (QSNs), persistent homology pipelines, and the GAIA-AIR / QAOS ecosystem.

These are not aerospace-specific tools. They are governance and computation primitives that work wherever artefact production must be deterministic, traceable, and fair — and wherever data relationships must be captured in their full topological complexity. The aerospace pillar is where they are first instantiated — but the architecture is designed for any IDEAL pillar to adopt them.

---

### What Drives This

Aircraft are the most documented machines on Earth. Every bolt has a part number, every procedure has a data module, every modification has a traceability chain. I work inside that documentation ecosystem professionally — and I've seen how the gap between engineering truth and published deliverables creates friction, ambiguity, and lost knowledge.

The frameworks here are my attempt to close that gap structurally: not by adding more documents, but by making the *process of producing documents* deterministic, traceable, and fair.

Fair to the people who do the work. Fair to the third parties whose ideas inform ours. Fair to the operators who depend on what we publish being correct. Fair across borders.

That is the European intelligence I want to found: not surveillance, but structural clarity. Not control, but governed openness. An inclusive model that can be adopted, adapted, and exported — because its architecture is invariant while its content is extensible.

---

### Contribution Philosophy

I operate under a governed recognition framework. External intellectual contributions — whether public domain references, licensed datasets, conceptual inspirations, or direct co-authorship — are explicitly declared, categorized (C1–C6), and ledger-anchored. Design authority is retained; attribution is never erased.

Recognition without dilution. Sovereignty without exclusion. Collaboration without loss of structural authorship.

This is the **S** in ESG made operational.

See: [STD-PATH-MTL-001 §3.1b — Contribution Governance](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel)

# Backend — Logical Architecture Encoding

> *What follows is the formal mathematical backbone behind the frameworks described above. It is organized to align with [STD-PATH-MTL-001](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel) and its annexes — the governing standard for the PATH → MTL pipeline, the DWGE intent-lock layer (§3.1a), and the Contribution Ledger Layer (§3.1b). The IDEAL-ESG pillar structure provides the domain decomposition; the standard family provides the governance mechanics.*

---

## Part I — Foundational Primitives

> *These primitives define the mathematical objects that OPT-IN (`§OPT-IN`) implements, that PATH → MTL (`§STD`) operates on, that the IDEAL pillar structure (`§IDEAL`) decomposes across domains, and that NBT gates (`§NBT`) bridge into quantum-augmented computation.*

### 1. Minimum Common Denominator (Open Aggregator)

> The minimal invariant structural core that enables interoperability while remaining extensible.

**Properties:** structural minimalism, shared constraint layer, open extension surface, deterministic governance, aggregation without fragmentation.

Let systems $S_i$ represent individual system instances. Let $F(S_i)$ denote the invariant structural features extracted from each system.

```math
\text{MCD} = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F(S_i)
```

The core is contained in all systems. Extensions exist outside the invariant core.

**`§OPT-IN` cross-reference:** The OPT-IN 5-axis topology (O-P-T-I-N) *is* the MCD for programme management across any IDEAL pillar. Every programme — whether in Aerospace, Energy, or Defense — instantiates the same five axes; domain-specific content lives in the extension layer. The invariant core guarantees that any two OPT-IN programmes are structurally navigable by the same toolchain.

**`§IDEAL` cross-reference:** IDEAL itself is an MCD at the enterprise level. The five pillars (I·D·E·A·L) share a common governance layer (ESG), a common pipeline (PATH → MTL), and a common incentive structure (TT). The pillar-specific content — hydrogen propulsion for Energy, certification evidence for Aerospace, supply chain traceability for Logistics — lives in the extension layer. The invariant core is the governance machinery.

### 2. Programme Outline as MCD System

A programme outline decomposes into invariant core + extension:

```math
M_i = C \oplus E_i
```

Where $C$ = invariant structural core, $E_i$ = module-specific extension, $C \cap E_i = \varnothing$.

| Layer | Content | `§OPT-IN` mapping | `§IDEAL` mapping |
|-------|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Identity (invariant)** | ID, Authority, Scope, Version, Lifecycle | OPT-IN axis headers + ATA chapter identifiers | IDEAL pillar + domain identifier |
| **Functional Core (invariant)** | Purpose, Interfaces, Dependencies, Risks, Compliance | LC01–LC14 lifecycle phases | ESG enforcement layer (E+S+G) |
| **Extension (variable)** | Domain-specific models, parametric analysis, trade studies | Per-ATA SSOT content | Pillar-specific engineering artefacts |

**`§STD` cross-reference:** The PATH → MTL heading block (artifact_id, knot_ref, ata_chapter, lifecycle_phase, procedure_ref, prompt_hash, template_version, classification, status) *is* the Identity Layer for every artefact. It is stamped by `WDG-TPL-REFORMAT` (`§3.1a` §7.1, widget #5) before any extension content is written. This heading is pillar-agnostic — the same schema applies whether the artefact belongs to aircraftmodel.eu or aerospacemodel.com.

### 3. Simplicial Partitioning of Possibility Space

Define state vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Admissible set:

```math
\mathcal{F} = \{x \mid g_i(x) \le 0,\ h_j(x)=0\}
```

Partition domain into simplices:

```math
\Omega = \bigcup_{\sigma \in K} \sigma
```

Classify simplices:

- **Fully admissible** — entire simplex lies within $\mathcal{F}$
- **Mixed boundary** — partial intersection with $\mathcal{F}$
- **Inadmissible** — no intersection with $\mathcal{F}$

Admissible subcomplex:

```math
\mathcal{F} \approx \bigcup_{\sigma \in K_{\text{adm}}} \sigma
```

**Structural benefits:** enumerability, local linear reasoning, adjacency graph, transition control.

**`§LC01` cross-reference:** Each KNOT corresponds to a mixed-boundary simplex — a region of the design space where admissibility is uncertain. The KNOT lifecycle (OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → CLOSED) is the process of resolving a mixed simplex into either $K_\text{adm}$ (closed with evidence) or $K_\text{inadm}$ (rejected). KNUs are the evidence artefacts that move a simplex from mixed to classified. The residual uncertainty score (0–100) in `KNOTS.csv` is a discretized measure of the mixed-boundary fraction.

**`§NBT` cross-reference:** The simplicial partitioning described here is not merely an abstract mathematical model — it has a computational realization through NBT gates. Each 0-simplex corresponds to a *NeuronBit* (a fundamental simplicial anchor unit) that the N-axis can bridge into quantum-augmented processing. When NeuronBit nodes combine under simplicial rules, they form the same $k$-simplices described above: 1-simplices encode pairwise relationships, 2-simplices encode three-body interactions, and higher-order simplices capture the multi-way correlations that classical graph representations lose. The admissible subcomplex $K_\text{adm}$ is therefore not just a mathematical set — it is a physically addressable structure that can cross NBT gates, where persistent homology and Betti number extraction execute via quantum parallel construction and tunnel back as gated evidence (see [Part IIIb](#part-iiib--nbt-gates-neural-network-bridging-and-tunneling)).

### 4. Voluntad as Directional Operator

Admissibility defines *permitted states*. Voluntad defines *direction of evolution*.

Objective functional $J(x)$. Constrained dynamic:

```math
\dot{x} = \Pi_{\mathcal{F}}(\nabla J(x))
```

On the simplicial adjacency graph:

```math
\sigma_0 \rightarrow \sigma_1 \rightarrow \dots
```

maximizing $J$ under the admissibility constraint.

Voluntad operates on position within the feasible manifold and on evolution of the constraint structure itself.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** PATH → MTL *is* the projection operator $\Pi_\mathcal{F}$. The pipeline constrains the gradient of intent (raw prompt → locked intent → approved procedure → templated artefact → gated acceptance → registered model → ledger entry). At no point can the system move outside $\mathcal{F}$ — that is the Monotonic Safety Property (MSP):

```math
S(T(B)) \geq S(B) \quad \text{and} \quad R(T(B)) \geq R(B)
```

or the tool refuses execution. The DWGE intent-lock (`§3.1a` §4.2) is the first enforcement point: nothing enters PATH until intent is frozen. The acceptance gates (`§STD`) are the second: nothing enters SSOT/PUB unless all gates pass. Together they guarantee that the system only moves along admissible trajectories.

**`§IDEAL` cross-reference:** The Voluntad functional $J$ is not purely technical. Across the IDEAL pillars, it encodes: environmental impact minimization (**E**SG), social fairness in attribution (**S** — `§3.1b`), and governance integrity (**G** — MSP + gate invariants). The projection $\Pi_\mathcal{F}$ therefore enforces not just technical admissibility but ESG admissibility at every step.

---

## Part II — Constrained Evolution (PATH → MTL as Projected Dynamics)

> *This section formalizes the relationship between the mathematical model in Part I and the pipeline mechanics defined in `§STD` and `§3.1a`.*

### 5. The Pipeline as Projection

The full pipeline composes as:

```math
\text{RAW} \xrightarrow{\text{DWGE}} \text{IntentSpec} \xrightarrow{\Pi_\mathcal{F}} \text{Artefact} \xrightarrow{\text{Gates}} \text{SSOT/PUB}
```

| Pipeline stage | Mathematical role | `§STD` / `§3.1a` reference |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| RAW prompt | Unconstrained gradient $\nabla J(x)$ | Human or automated trigger |
| WDG-INTENT-PARSE (#1) | Project onto candidate feasible directions | `§3.1a` §4.2, state: INTERPRET |
| WDG-INTENT-CONFIRM (#2) | Lock direction (freeze IntentSpec) | `§3.1a` §4.2, state: CONFIRM |
| WDG-PROC-MATCH (#3) | Verify direction lies within procedure envelope | `§3.1a` §7.1, PATH stage A |
| WDG-TPL-SELECT (#4) | Select canonical coordinate frame | `§3.1a` §7.1, PATH stage T |
| WDG-TPL-REFORMAT (#5) | Transform into canonical representation | `§3.1a` §6.2, reformat decision |
| Operator execution | Compute step along constrained trajectory | PATH stage H |
| WDG-CHECK-COMPLETENESS (#6) | Verify step is well-defined | PATH stage → TO, GATE-COMPLETENESS |
| WDG-BREX-VALIDATE (#7) | Verify S1000D boundary conditions (PUB only) | PATH stage → TO, GATE-BREX |
| WDG-CONTRIBUTION-MAP (#10) | Verify provenance and attribution | `§3.1b` §6, GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED, GATE-IP-CLEAR |
| WDG-REGISTER-MODEL (#8) | Commit to configuration baseline | PATH stage → M |
| WDG-LEDGER-WRITE (#9) | Hash-chain provenance record | PATH stage → L, TEKNIA ledger |

**10 widgets. 8 gates. 2 touch LLM. 8 deterministic. 1 optional LLM. The system is closed.**

### 6. Monotonic Safety Property (MSP)

The aggregated GenAI layer SHALL operate under a monotonic safety constraint such that no artefact entering SSOT or PUB decreases verified safety margins, traceability completeness, or regulatory compliance relative to the certified baseline.

**Guaranteed by architecture, not by LLM behaviour:**

| Containment mechanism | `§STD` enforcement point |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| No direct baseline mutation | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL requires all gates passed |
| Constraint envelope guard | WDG-PROC-MATCH verifies against `constraints_envelope` |
| Margin preservation | GATE-BOUNDS-CHECK enforces numerical ranges |
| Traceability integrity | GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE verifies all cross-references |
| Hash chain continuity | GATE-HASH-INTEGRITY verifies `prev_tx_hash` |
| No non-admissible state jumps | IntentSpec confirmation policy (`§3.1a` §5.3) |

### 7. Qualification Target

> Don't qualify GenAI. Qualify GenAI *usage*.

The Qualified System-of-Tools (QSOT) = the aggregated governance layer:

| QSOT component | `§STD` location |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Intent lock layer | `§3.1a` — DWGE (widgets #1–2 + confirmation policy) |
| Approved procedure registry | `.path_mtl/procedures/PROCEDURE_INDEX.csv` |
| Canonical templates | `.path_mtl/templates/TEMPLATE_INDEX.csv` |
| Acceptance gates | `.path_mtl/gates/GATE_INDEX.csv` |
| Model registration rules | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL (#8) |
| Ledger / provenance | WDG-LEDGER-WRITE (#9) + `ledger.json` |
| Replay harness | `§3.1a` §10 — conformance tests |
| Contribution governance | `§3.1b` — CLL (widget #10 + gates) |

The LLM is a bounded inference component whose outputs are never accepted without deterministic controls. The foundation model is under configuration control but is not the qualified element.

**Q-criterion:** A GenAI-enabled pipeline is qualifiable if, for any prompt $p$, either the pipeline returns REJECT/ESCALATE, or it returns an artefact $a$ such that: (1) $a$ conforms to template + schema, (2) all gates pass deterministically, (3) $a$ is fully traceable to frozen intent and procedure version, (4) the decision record is replayable.

---

## Part III — Certification State Space

> *This section formalizes the simplex classification model and maps it to the gate system defined in `§STD`.*

### 8. Simplex Classification

Let $\sigma = \text{conv}\{v_0, \dots, v_d\}$. Let admissibility be $A(x)$ and feasible set $\mathcal{F} = \{x : A(x) = \text{true}\}$.

Three Boolean tests:

- **Vertex feasibility:** $V(\sigma) = \bigwedge_k A(v_k)$
- **Existence feasibility:** $E(\sigma) = \exists\, x \in \sigma : A(x)$
- **Full inclusion:** $I(\sigma) = \forall\, x \in \sigma : A(x)$

| Class | Condition | `§LC01` mapping |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Fully admissible | $I(\sigma)$ | KNOT status = CLOSED, residual ≤ target |
| Inadmissible | $\neg E(\sigma)$ | KNOT closed as REJECTED (infeasible) |
| Mixed boundary | $E(\sigma) \land \neg I(\sigma)$ | KNOT status = OPEN or IN_PROGRESS |

### 9. Resolution Policies

| Policy | Rule | `§STD` mapping | When to use |
|--------|------|----------------|-------------|
| **A — Fail-Closed** | Accept only $K_\text{full}$; reject mixed until refined | Release / certification baseline | Early certification, safety-critical, sparse evidence |
| **B — Inner-Approximation** | Compute safe polytope $\sigma_\text{safe} \subset \sigma \cap \mathcal{F}$ | GATE-BOUNDS-CHECK clipping | Continuity of design search with no unsafe leakage |
| **C — Conditional** | Mixed → admissible iff evidence conditions $C_m$ satisfied | KNU acceptance gates | Innovation boundary with SC/AMC/MoC |
| **D — Probabilistic** | Not for certification claims | Exploration only | Internal trade studies, surrogate models |

Conditional admissibility:

```math
A(x) = A_0(x) \land \bigwedge_m \bigl(\text{if } C_m(x) \text{ then } A_m(x)\bigr)
```

Sub-classifications:

- **Admissible (conditional):** feasible iff evidence packages satisfied → `KNU.status = COMPLETE`
- **Admissible (probationary):** prototype/experimental envelope only → `KNU.status = IN_PROGRESS`
- **Not admissible:** missing/failed evidence gates → `KNU.status = PLANNED` (blocked)

**`§STD` cross-reference:** The 4 blocked KNUs identified in the TLAR programme (KNOT-TLAR-01-005, -05-006, -08-005, -10-001) are mixed-boundary simplices under Policy C. They become admissible only when their procedure-qualification KNOTs are closed — which is exactly what WDG-PROC-MATCH (`§3.1a` §7.1) enforces at the A-stage gate.

### 10. Three-Set Partition (Implementation)

Maintain three simplex sets at each time step:

| Set | Purpose | `§STD` mapping | Certification use |
|-----|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| $K_\text{full}(t)$ | Fully admissible | KNOT CLOSED + all gates PASS | Release / certification baseline |
| $K_\text{cond}(t)$ | Conditionally admissible | KNOT IN_PROGRESS + evidence gates open | Requires evidence closure |
| $K_\text{explore}$ | Exploration only | No KNOT registered; DEV-class artefacts | Never for certification claims |

**Deterministic invariants:**

| ID | Rule | `§STD` enforcement |
|----|------|-------------------|
| INV-001 | No certification claim may reference any simplex outside $K_\text{full}(t)$ | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL blocks non-gated artefacts |
| INV-002 | State transitions must be monotone unless a regulatory rollback event is recorded with `regulatory_event_id` + `signed_approval` | GATE-HASH-INTEGRITY + ledger immutability |
| INV-003 | Every gate requires `evidence_refs[]`, `approvals[]`, and `run_manifest_ref` before closing | Gate schema in `.path_mtl/gates/` |

### 11. Evidence-Gated State Machine

For each mixed simplex $\sigma$ (equivalently, each KNOT):

```
MIXED ──[moc_pkg]──▶ CONDITIONAL ──[evidence approved]──▶ FULL
  │                         │
  ├──[refine]───────────────┘
  └──[refine]──▶ INADMISSIBLE

        CONDITIONAL ──[evidence fail]──▶ REJECTED

Rollbacks (require regulatory_event_id + signed_approval):
  FULL ──[regulatory_rollback]──▶ CONDITIONAL
  CONDITIONAL ──[regulatory_rollback]──▶ MIXED
```

**`§LC01` cross-reference:** This state machine is the KNOT lifecycle:

| State machine state | KNOT status | KNU status | Residual |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| MIXED | OPEN | PLANNED | 100 |
| CONDITIONAL | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS / COMPLETE | 100 > R > target |
| FULL | CLOSED | ACCEPTED | R ≤ target |
| INADMISSIBLE | CLOSED (rejected) | N/A | N/A |

TT distribution occurs only at FULL transition. The formula from `§LC01`:

```math
w_i = \alpha \cdot \hat{E}_i + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \hat{I}_i \quad;\quad T_i = P_k \cdot w_i
```

### 12. Time-Dependent Constraint Dynamics

```math
\mathcal{F}(t) = \{x \in \Omega : A(x,t) = \text{true}\}
```

Decomposition:

```math
A(x,t) = A_\text{hard}(x,t) \land A_\text{soft}(x,t) \land A_\text{evidence}(x,t)
```

| Layer | Description | Evolution driver | `§STD` mapping |
|-------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Hard** | Statutes, fundamental safety requirements | Rarely relaxed | CS-25 / FAR Part 25 constraints |
| **Soft** | AMC/GM, interpretive guidance, MoC ranges | Regulators | Special Conditions, CRI responses |
| **Evidence** | TRL, test coverage, approved analyses | Programme maturity | KNU artefacts closing KNOTs |

Change event stream:

```math
\Delta K_\text{adm}^{+} = K_\text{adm}(t+\Delta t) \setminus K_\text{adm}(t) \qquad \text{(gains — cells become admissible)}
```
```math
\Delta K_\text{adm}^{-} = K_\text{adm}(t) \setminus K_\text{adm}(t+\Delta t) \qquad \text{(losses — rare, regulatory rollback)}
```

Regulatory expansion:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{aero}(t+\Delta t) = \mathcal{F}_\text{aero}(t) \cup \Delta\mathcal{F}_\text{SC/AMC} \cup \Delta\mathcal{F}_\text{evidence}
```

**`§STD` cross-reference:** Each $\Delta\mathcal{F}_\text{evidence}$ event corresponds to a KNU reaching ACCEPTED status. The ledger (`WDG-LEDGER-WRITE`, widget #9) records the timestamp, artefact hash, and gate results — creating an auditable time-series of $K_\text{adm}(t)$ evolution.

## Part IIIb — NBT Gates (Neural Network Bridging and Tunneling)

> *This section formalizes NBT gates (`§NBT`) as the operational definition of the N-axis in OPT-IN. Where Parts I–III define the simplicial state space and its constrained evolution within the classical governance domain, Part IIIb defines the gate layer that bridges classical interface outputs into quantum-augmented complex manifolds and tunnels results back. The NeuronBit — a simplicial anchor unit — is the fundamental data structure that flows through NBT gates.*

### 13. NBT Gates — N-Axis Operational Definition

In the OPT-IN 5-axis topology, the first four axes (O-P-T-I) produce classical artefacts governed by deterministic pipelines. The fifth axis — **N (Neural Networks)** — is where the architecture crosses the classical-quantum boundary. NBT gates are the connections at that boundary.

**NBT** = **N**eural Network **B**ridging and **T**unneling.

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Bridging** | Classical interface outputs (registered artefacts, locked IntentSpecs, gated evidence) are translated into quantum state preparations and injected into simplicial complexes on the QPU |
| **Tunneling** | Quantum-augmented results (persistent homology invariants, Betti numbers, topological classifications) are mapped back into geometric structures that the classical pipeline can consume without inducing decoherent collapse |
| **Gate** | The deterministic boundary control — nothing crosses from classical to quantum or back without satisfying the same gate invariants (INV-001–003) that govern classical registration |

The **NeuronBit** (the simplicial unit that flows through NBT gates) is structured not as a scalar (classical bit), not as a probability amplitude (qubit), but as a **topological anchor point** in a simplicial complex:

| Property | Classical bit | Qubit | NeuronBit (simplicial unit) |
|----------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| State | Deterministic: $\{0, 1\}$ | Superposition: $\alpha\|0\rangle + \beta\|1\rangle$ | Simplicial: node in $K$ with adjacency, boundary, and coboundary operators |
| Relationships | Pairwise (edges in flat graphs) | Entangled pairs/registers | Higher-order ($n$-simplices for $n$-body interactions) |
| Context | Inferred *a posteriori* (joins, lookups) | Encoded in entanglement structure | **Intrinsic** — the topology *is* the context |
| Persistence | RAM / register | Coherence-limited | Topologically persistent (survives across filtration scales) |

**`§OPT-IN` cross-reference:** Each ATA chapter node in the OPT-IN topology is a 0-simplex (NeuronBit anchor). Cross-chapter dependencies (e.g. ATA 28 fuel ↔ ATA 24 electrical power ↔ ATA 71 power plant) form higher-order simplices. The OPT-IN structure *is* a simplicial complex. The four classical axes (O-P-T-I) produce artefacts that populate this complex; the N-axis (NBT gates) bridges the complex into quantum-augmented processing and tunnels invariants back.

**`§3.1a` cross-reference:** The DWGE intent-lock freezes *semantic* state before classical pipeline execution. NBT gates freeze *topological* state before quantum execution. Both are projection operators that prevent uncontrolled state mutation — DWGE at the governance layer, NBT at the computation layer. The combined architecture: DWGE → PATH → MTL → **NBT gate (bridge)** → QPU → **NBT gate (tunnel)** → classical registration.

### 14. Bridging and Tunneling Mechanics

The NBT gate operates bidirectionally across the classical-quantum boundary:

```math
\underbrace{\text{O-P-T-I}}_{\text{classical axes}} \xrightarrow[\text{BRIDGE}]{\text{NBT gate}} \underbrace{\text{QPU (simplicial manifold)}}_{\text{quantum-augmented}} \xrightarrow[\text{TUNNEL}]{\text{NBT gate}} \underbrace{\text{N-axis registration}}_{\text{classical evidence}}
```

**Bridge path** (classical → quantum):

1. PATH → MTL produces a registered artefact (e.g. structural sensor data, KNOT evidence complex, TLAR parameter set)
2. NBT gate translates the artefact into a simplicial state preparation — encoding NeuronBit anchor points, their adjacency operators, and boundary/coboundary maps as quantum states
3. QPU receives the prepared state and processes it in quantum parallelism (superposition of all $k$-simplices)

**Tunnel path** (quantum → classical):

1. QPU computation produces a probabilistic distribution (topological invariants, Betti numbers, persistent homology diagrams)
2. NBT gate maps the distribution back into a multidimensional geometric structure — not raw quantum measurement, but a topologically coherent result that preserves the simplicial relationships
3. The result enters the classical N-axis as a gated evidence artefact, subject to the same INV-001–003 invariants as any SSOT/PUB registration

This resolves the critical **temporal synchronization** problem: classical circuits operate at GHz clock speeds; quantum gate times (trapped ions, superconducting circuits) are orders of magnitude slower; entanglement lifetimes are fleeting. The NBT gate's topological persistence bridges the timescale gap by preserving geometric coherence across the computation lifecycle — the simplicial structure is the synchronization medium.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** The bridge path is equivalent to a `WDG-TPL-REFORMAT` transformation from classical artefact schema into simplicial state schema. The tunnel path is equivalent to `WDG-CHECK-COMPLETENESS` + `WDG-REGISTER-MODEL` on the returning quantum evidence. The same pipeline mechanics apply — the domain changes from semantic to topological, but the governance is invariant.

### 15. Information Threads and Persistent Homology (Quantum-Side Processing)

On the quantum side of the NBT gate, connected NeuronBit simplices form **information threads** — continuous topological trajectories that encode not just data values but the geometric relationships between them. This is what the QPU operates on after the bridge.

The analytical framework for extracting invariants from these threads is **persistent homology**. It tracks the birth and death of topological features (connected components, holes, voids) across filtration scales $\epsilon$:

```math
H_k(K_{\epsilon_1}) \rightarrow H_k(K_{\epsilon_2}) \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow H_k(K_{\epsilon_n})
```

The key invariants are the **Betti numbers** $\beta_k$:

- $\beta_0$ = number of connected components (clusters of related data)
- $\beta_1$ = number of 1-dimensional holes (information gaps, missing evidence loops)
- $\beta_2$ = number of 2-dimensional voids (enclosed regions of uncertainty)
- $\beta_k$ = higher-dimensional topological features

**Classical bottleneck:** Computing persistent homology classically requires $O(2^n)$ memory for the Vietoris-Rips filtration — exponential scaling that makes large-scale topological analysis intractable.

**Quantum acceleration via NBT:** The architecture offloads topological analysis to the quantum domain in two steps:

1. **Parallel simplicial state construction** — Grover-accelerated construction of quantum states encoding all $k$-simplices in superposition, requiring $\log m$ qubits (exponentially fewer than classical bits) and $O(\zeta^{-1/2} n^2 \log m)$ time.

2. **Betti number extraction via quantum phase estimation** — The Betti numbers correspond to kernel dimensions of the combinatorial Laplacian. Continuous-variable phase estimation on the Dirac operator produces probability distributions whose peaks directly reveal the topological invariants.

**`§LC01` cross-reference:** In the KNOT uncertainty model, a $\beta_1 > 0$ (persistent hole) in the evidence complex for a given ATA node signals an **unresolved information gap** — a loop of dependencies where no KNU has yet closed the cycle. This is a mathematical formalization of what the KNOT register captures as `Status: OPEN` with `Residual > target`. The NBT architecture makes this detection computable in polynomial quantum time rather than exponential classical time.

### 16. Quantum Simplicial Neural Networks (QSNs) — Execution on the Quantum Side

The algorithmic execution layer for data that has crossed the NBT bridge is the **Quantum Simplicial Neural Network (QSN)**. QSNs extend quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) from pairwise interactions to higher-order simplicial processing.

Architecture: a QSN is a sequential stack of **Quantum Simplicial Layers (QSLs)** followed by a classical MLP readout.

| QSL variant | Mechanism | Generalization | Optimal use |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **BQSL** (Base) | Ising-inspired interactions encoding node-node, node-edge, edge-edge correlations | Generalizes to arbitrary dimensional simplices | Full-complex topological feature extraction |
| **SQSL** (Schematic) | Hyperlocal abstraction with high precision | Limited to lower-order simplices | Targeted feature extraction with high accuracy |

Both variants use **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)** — parameterized quantum gates optimized iteratively by a classical processor to minimize a task-specific loss function.

**Performance:** Empirical results on synthetic classification tasks show QSNs systematically outperform classical topological deep learning models in both inferential accuracy and computational efficiency — validating the practical viability of combining quantum parallelism with simplicial data structures.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** Within the PATH → MTL pipeline, QSN inference is invoked on the quantum side of the NBT bridge. Results tunnel back through NBT gates as topological evidence — for example, gap detection at the `WDG-CHECK-COMPLETENESS` stage (#6) identifying missing evidence threads across the simplicial complex before registration. The Q-criterion (`§3.1a` §7) governs the qualification of QSN-based gate checks: the QSN is a bounded inference component whose outputs must pass deterministic gates before entering the classical baseline.

### 17. GAIA-AIR and QAOS — N-Axis Aerospace Realization

The most concrete implementation of NBT gates is **GAIA-AIR** and its **Quantum Aerospace Operating System (QAOS)** — a full N-axis instantiation where classical aerospace telemetry crosses into quantum-augmented structural analysis and tunnels back as operational evidence:

| GAIA-AIR module | NBT gate function | Operational function |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **QAOS** (operating system) | CPU/QPU bridge+tunnel via NeuronBit information threads | Quantum-classical orchestration, data flow traceability |
| **Robbbo-T / Ampel** | Sensor data bridged to 0-simplices (NeuronBit nodes) on QPU | Topological anomaly detection for predictive maintenance |
| **Digital twin** | Persistent homology tunneled back as structural evidence | Real-time structural monitoring; anomaly = topological void |
| **QPS** (Quantum Propulsion System) | Multi-body fluid dynamics bridged via higher-order simplices | Thrust optimization, CFD acceleration |
| **TerraQueUeing GreenTech** | Topological noise correction as "polarization mapping" | Energy-efficient quantum resource scheduling; ESG-aligned |

**Predictive maintenance via NBT gates:** Instead of classical threshold-based wear monitoring, the digital twin bridges structural sensor data across NBT gates to compute persistent homology on the QPU. A material anomaly manifests as a **topological void** ($\beta_2$ increase) in the structural simplicial complex — detectable before physical failure. The result tunnels back as a gated evidence artefact, triggering maintenance action through the classical O-P-T-I axes.

**`§IDEAL` cross-reference:** GAIA-AIR instantiates multiple IDEAL pillars simultaneously: **A** (aerospace platform), **I** (NBT data architecture), **E** (green quantum scheduling), **L** (material lifecycle traceability via DPP). The TerraQueUeing GreenTech philosophy — reserving quantum resources surgically for topological extraction while delegating storage and boolean logic to optimized classical infrastructure — embodies the **E** in ESG at the hardware scheduling level.

**Normalization imperative:** NBT gates serve as a **hardware-agnostic topological abstraction layer**. Whether the QPU uses superconducting circuits, trapped ions, neutral atoms, or photonic processors, the classical axes communicate exclusively in simplicial data constraints and information thread specifications — the NBT gate handles the translation. This is the same normalization philosophy that S1000D provides for technical publications, OPT-IN provides for programme structure, and DWGE provides for semantic intent: a common interface standard that makes the underlying implementation swappable without disrupting governance.

---

## Part IV — Civil-Aerospace Embedding and IDEAL Pillar Coupling

> *This section formalizes the relationship between the aerospace design space, the broader civil governance manifold, and the IDEAL pillar structure. S1000D and DPP act as boundary certificates at the interface.*

### 18. Civil System

```math
S_\text{civil} = (P, I, R, B, C)
```

Where $P$ = population parameters, $I$ = infrastructure, $R$ = regulatory framework, $B$ = budgetary constraints, $C$ = cultural-legitimacy parameters.

Admissibility constraints: legal, fiscal, capacity, stability.

### 19. Civil Aerospace as Submanifold

```math
S_\text{aero} = (A, O, R, I, F)
```

Where $A$ = aircraft & assets, $O$ = operators, $R$ = regulators, $I$ = infrastructure, $F$ = financial structure.

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{aero} = S(x) \land C(x) \land E(x) \land F(x)
```

Safety compliance ∧ certification validity ∧ environmental conformity ∧ financial sustainability.

Key structural relation:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{aero} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_\text{civil}
```

Aerospace is a safety-critical submanifold of civil governance. Transition principle: adjacency-based reform, certification-bounded evolution, no non-admissible state jumps.

### 20. IDEAL Pillar Coupling

The IDEAL pillars are not independent. They interact through shared constraints and interface operators:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{IDEAL}(t) = \bigcap_{p \in \{I,D,E,A,L\}} \mathcal{F}_p(t) \quad \cap \quad \mathcal{F}_\text{ESG}(t)
```

Where each pillar has its own admissible set, and ESG provides the transversal constraint:

| Pillar | State variables | Admissibility constraints | Interface with **A** |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **I — Information** | Data schemas, AI models, publication structures | Data sovereignty, GDPR, deterministic outputs | ATA 46/95/96/97 — information systems, AI/ML, traceability |
| **D — Defense** | Dual-use classification, export status, supply chain clearance | EU Reg. 2021/821, national security review | `§3.1b` §5.2 — export control gates, GATE-IP-CLEAR |
| **E — Energy** | H₂ production, storage, distribution, grid coupling | Safety (ATEX, PED), availability, carbon intensity | ATA 28 (LH₂ fuel), I-axis (H₂ GSE), TLAR energy balance |
| **A — Aerospace** | Aircraft design, certification, operations | CS-25, S1000D, DO-178C, DO-254 | Primary domain |
| **L — Logistics** | Supply chain, manufacturing, end-of-life | DPP Regulation, circular economy, material traceability | LC09 (production), LC14 (circularity), ATA 96 (DPP) |

**Cross-pillar coupling constraints** (AMPEL360 Q100 specific):

| Coupling | Pillars | `§OPT-IN` axis | Evidence function |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Airport LH₂ infrastructure readiness | **E** ↔ **A** | **I** — Infrastructures | $\Gamma_\text{H₂-infra}(x_E, x_A, t)$ |
| Dual-use screening of propulsion technology | **D** ↔ **A** | **N** — Neural Networks | GATE-IP-CLEAR via `§3.1b` |
| Supply chain provenance for LH₂ | **L** ↔ **E** | **N** — Neural Networks | $E_\text{dpp}(x,t)$ via ATA 96 |
| AI model qualification for flight systems | **I** ↔ **A** | **T** — Technologies | Q-criterion via `§3.1a` §7 |
| Circular economy compliance | **L** ↔ **A** | **I** — Infrastructures | LC14 + DPP traceability |
| Topological telemetry processing | **I** ↔ **A** | **T** — Technologies | $\beta_k$ extraction via `§NBT` QSN |

**`§IDEAL` cross-reference:** The admissible set $\mathcal{F}_\text{IDEAL}$ is the intersection of all pillar constraints plus ESG. No artefact, in any pillar, enters the model baseline unless it satisfies the governance layer. This is why the standard family (§STD + §3.1a + §3.1b) is pillar-agnostic by design: the pipeline, the gates, and the ledger work the same whether the artefact is a TLAR analysis, a hydrogen safety study, or a supply chain traceability record.

### 21. ESG as Transversal Constraint

ESG is not a reporting layer. It is a structural constraint that binds all IDEAL pillars:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{ESG}(t) = \mathcal{F}_E(t) \land \mathcal{F}_S(t) \land \mathcal{F}_G(t)
```

| ESG dimension | Formal constraint | `§STD` enforcement | IDEAL pillars affected |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **E — Environment** | No artefact may degrade lifecycle environmental metrics (emissions, materials, circularity) relative to baseline | LC14 evidence, DPP validation, climate impact gates | E, A, L |
| **S — Social** | No artefact may enter SSOT/PUB without a complete contribution map; no contributor may be erased from the ledger | GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED, `§3.1b` C1–C6 taxonomy | All pillars |
| **G — Governance** | MSP holds; all transitions are monotone, gated, and ledger-anchored; no improvisation past IntentLock | INV-001–003, GATE-HASH-INTEGRITY, confirmation policy | All pillars |

This makes ESG a *structural invariant*, not a *compliance add-on*. It is enforced by the same gate system that enforces safety. It cannot be switched off without disabling the pipeline itself.

### 22. Documentation as Evidence Functions

```math
\Gamma(x,y,t) = \Gamma_0(x,y,t) \land E_\text{doc}(x,t) \land E_\text{dpp}(x,t)
```

| Evidence system | Proves | `§STD` mapping | IDEAL pillar |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **S1000D / ATA** | Maintainability, operational control, procedures, configuration management | PUB/CSDB — DM, PM, DML, BREX, APPLICABILITY | I, A |
| **Digital Product Passport** | Provenance, materials compliance, sustainability, lifecycle traceability | SSOT/LC14_RETIREMENT_CIRCULARITY + ATA 96 (N-axis) | L, E, A |

These are not just publications — they are *boundary certificates* that prove the interface operator $\Gamma$ holds. Without valid documentation, the aircraft cannot be shown to be globally admissible even if its engineering state $x$ lies within $\mathcal{F}_\text{aero}$.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** GATE-BREX validates S1000D boundary conditions. GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE validates that documentation references are complete and resolvable. Together they enforce $E_\text{doc}(x,t)$ at every artefact registration.

---

## Part V — Contribution Governance & Contributions Registry

> *This section aligns with `§3.1b` — the Contribution Ledger Layer (CLL). It encodes the **S** in ESG as operational architecture.*

### 23. Contribution Taxonomy

Per `§3.1b` §3, every external influence is classified into exactly one category:

| Code | Category | Sovereignty impact | Design authority transfer | `§3.1b` ref |
|------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **C1** | Public domain reference | None | None | §3 |
| **C2** | Licensed dataset | Traceable dependency | None | §3 |
| **C3** | Conceptual inspiration | None (sovereign transformation) | None | §3 |
| **C4** | Co-developed procedure | Shared method claim | On procedure only | §3 |
| **C5** | Toolchain integration | No design claim | None | §3 |
| **C6** | Direct artifact co-author | Shared authorship | On specific artifact | §3 |

**Sovereign transformation test** (`§3.1b` §3.1): A contribution is sovereignly transformed when (1) the external input served as inspiration or data source, AND (2) the programme applied its own procedures, templates, and governance, AND (3) the resulting artefact carries original content not present in the source, AND (4) the artefact would exist in substantially the same form with an equivalent source.

**Enforcement:** WDG-CONTRIBUTION-MAP (`§3.1b` §6, widget #10) fires on every SSOT/PUB artefact. GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED blocks registration if external references are detected without a declared contribution map. GATE-IP-CLEAR blocks registration for C4/C6 contributions without IP clearance.

### 24. Programme-Level Declarations

| Source | Code | Sovereign transformation | `§3.1b` ref |
|--------|------|--------------------------|-------------|
| GLOWOPT D2.2 (EU H2020 Grant 865300) | C1 | YES — all values re-derived for Q100 scale | §8.1 |
| ECMWF ERA5 | C2 | YES — raw data processed through PROC-TLAR-WIND | §8.2 |
| LLM provider (via DWGE adapter) | C5 | YES — LLM is intent normalizer only | §8.3 |

### 25. Contributions Registry — Backend-Auditable Classification

Structured technical classification of contributions by Amedeo Pelliccia, formalized for backend audit.

| ID | Domain | Type | TRL | Cert. relevance | `§STD` component | IDEAL pillar |
|----|--------|------|-----|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| CONTRIB-001 | OPT-IN / Open Architecture | Open structural framework | 2–3 | High | `§OPT-IN` — 5-axis topology + LC01–LC14 | All (MCD) |
| CONTRIB-002 | AMPEL360 — H₂-Electric BWB | Open conceptual design | 1–2 | Medium | TLAR nodes 01–10, SSOT artefacts | A, E |
| CONTRIB-003 | S1000D / ATA / BREX Standardization | Structured normalization | 3–4 | High | PUB/CSDB architecture, GATE-BREX | I, A |
| CONTRIB-004 | Critical AI & Determinism (DWGE) | Deterministic governance layer | 2–3 | High | `§3.1a` — widgets #1–10, MSP, Q-criterion | I, G |
| CONTRIB-005 | PATH → MTL Pipeline | Traceable production governance | 2–3 | High | `§STD` — pipeline, gates, ledger | G (ESG core) |
| CONTRIB-006 | Teknia Token Incentive Layer | Hash-chained incentive system | 1–2 | Medium | `§LC01` — TOKENOMICS_TT, AWARDS_TT | S (ESG core) |
| CONTRIB-007 | Contribution Governance (CLL) | Attribution + sovereignty framework | 2–3 | Medium | `§3.1b` — C1–C6 taxonomy, widget #10 | S (ESG core) |
| CONTRIB-008 | IDEAL-ESG Pillar Architecture | Integrating model for European capability | 1–2 | Medium | `§IDEAL` — pillar decomposition, ESG constraints | All |
| CONTRIB-009 | European Policy Frameworks | Federal strategy + Agenda 2028 | 1 | Low | Modello-federativo-europeo, Agenda-2028 | D, I, L |
| CONTRIB-010 | NBT Gates (Neural Network Bridging and Tunneling) | N-axis gate layer + NeuronBit simplicial units | 1–2 | High | `§NBT` — bridge/tunnel gates, QSN, persistent homology, quantum-classical boundary | N-axis (all pillars) |
| CONTRIB-011 | GAIA-AIR / QAOS Ecosystem | Quantum aerospace operating system | 1–2 | Medium | `§NBT` — QAOS orchestration, digital twins, predictive maintenance, QPS | A, E, I, L |

**Consolidated evaluation:**

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| High formal structuring | Systems with architecture, not isolated ideas |
| Certification orientation | Logic anchored to compliance even at conceptual stage |
| Determinism pursuit | Explicit reduction of semantic and structural ambiguity |
| Multi-domain integration | Aeronautics + documentation + AI + governance + policy |
| Open publication | Intellectual transfer under governed recognition |
| ESG-structural | Environment, Social, Governance encoded as gate constraints, not reporting layers |

**Strategic observation:**

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Structural coherence | High — standard family (§STD + §3.1a + §3.1b) + IDEAL-ESG are self-consistent |
| Institutional formalization | Low — requires industrial adoption, academic collaboration, policy engagement |
| Dependencies | Validated-product transformation, regulatory engagement, toolchain implementation, European institutional anchoring |
| Export potential | High — pillar-agnostic governance, adaptable to non-EU contexts via MCD invariance |

## Structural Synthesis

The complete system is defined by:

```math
(\Omega,\ K,\ \mathcal{F},\ J)
```

Where $\Omega$ = state space, $K$ = simplicial partition, $\mathcal{F}$ = admissible subcomplex, $J$ = Voluntad functional.

Dynamics:

```math
\dot{x} = \Pi_{\mathcal{F}}(\nabla J(x))
```

**The standard family and IDEAL-ESG implement this:**

| Mathematical object | Implementation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| $\Omega$ | IDEAL 5-pillar space × OPT-IN 5-axis topology × 79 ATA chapters |
| $K$ | KNOT register (uncertainty partitioning) |
| $\mathcal{F}$ | Acceptance gates + ESG constraints (deterministic boundary) |
| $J$ | Programme objectives (range, payload, emissions, cost, fairness, sovereignty) |
| $\Pi_\mathcal{F}$ | PATH → MTL pipeline (projection operator) |
| $\nabla J$ | Raw intent (prompts, design goals, policy objectives) |
| $\dot{x}$ | Registered artefacts (constrained trajectory) |
| Provenance of $\dot{x}$ | TEKNIA ledger (hash-chained evidence) |
| Attribution of $\dot{x}$ | Contribution maps (`§3.1b`) |
| Domain decomposition | IDEAL pillars (I·D·E·A·L) |
| Transversal constraint | ESG (E·S·G) |
| Computational substrate | NBT gates (`§NBT`) — bridge classical outputs into quantum manifolds, tunnel invariants back |
| Topological invariants | Betti numbers $\beta_k$ extracted via quantum phase estimation on QPU side of NBT gate |
| Aerospace realization | GAIA-AIR / QAOS — N-axis instantiation: digital twins, QPS, TerraQueUeing |

Constraints define stability. Simplices define discrete feasible regions. Voluntad defines direction. Governance defines the projection rule. ESG defines the ethical boundary. IDEAL defines the scope. NBT gates bridge it into quantum-augmented computation and tunnel results back.

It is structural logic, not rhetoric.

### Recommended Defaults

| Domain | Policy | `§STD` enforcement |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Certification baseline | Fail-closed (only $K_\text{full}$) | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL + INV-001 |

| Design exploration | Inner-approximation clipping + refinement; never probabilistic for claims | DEV-class artefacts (RULE_2 in `§3.1a` §6.2) |
| Regulatory evolution | Time-index predicates $A(x,t)$; log deltas to $K_\text{full}(t)$ / $K_\text{cond}(t)$ | Ledger time-series |
| Civil–aero coupling | Enforce $\Gamma(x,y,t)$ with S1000D/ATA + DPP as evidence functions | GATE-BREX + GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE |
| Contribution governance | Declare before register; never erase | GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED + GATE-IP-CLEAR |
| Cross-pillar coupling | Enforce $\mathcal{F}_\text{IDEAL}$ intersection at every registration | Pillar-specific gates + ESG transversal |
