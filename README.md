I am a researcher moved by genuine desire to originate something powerful.

By day I work as an aerospace engineer specializing in aircraft technical data structures and publications — S1000D, ATA iSpec 2200, CSDB architecture, the kind of documentation engineering that sits between what an aircraft *is* and what operators, maintainers and regulators *need to know about it*.

What I am building here goes beyond aerospace. It is an integrating model — inclusive by design, European in origin, exportable by structure.

### IDEALE-ESG.eu — European Intelligence Foundation

**IDEALE** is both an acronym and a commitment. It names the six pillars of an integrated framework for sovereign European capability:

<table>

<td align="center" width="16.6%"><h3>E</h3><strong>Energy</strong></td>

<td valign="top"><em>Governed digital economy: evidence markets, qualified model exchange, contribution assets, tokenized recognition, uncertainty reduction as transferable value</em></td>
</tr>
</table>

**ESG** is not a label — it is the structural guarantee that every IDEALE pillar operates under:

| | Principle | How it is encoded |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| **E** | **Environment** | LC14 circularity, Digital Product Passports, climate impact functions, zero-emission propulsion, lifecycle traceability |
| **S** | **Social responsibility** | Fair attribution (C1–C6 taxonomy), governed recognition of third parties, open publication, Teknia Token incentives proportional to contribution |
| **G** | **Governance** | Deterministic pipelines (PATH → MTL), intent-lock layers (DWGE), acceptance gates, hash-chained ledgers, monotonic safety property, sovereign design authority |

The IDEALE pillars define *what* we build. ESG defines *how* we build it. The sixth pillar — **Economy (Digital)** — closes the loop: it converts the governed production of evidence, models, and contributions into transferable value. Without it, the system is technically coherent but not self-sustaining. With it, uncertainty reduction has a reward, evidence has a market, and traceable contribution becomes an economic asset. The combination is an inclusive, integrating model — designed in Europe, structured for export.

The Economy pillar is not fintech, not crypto, not e-commerce. It is **governed industrial digital economy**: audited, regulated, traceable, and aligned with European regulation. Not speculation — certified impact.

### Two Domains — The Aerospace Pillar

Here on GitHub I collapse the **A** pillar into two owned domains, each redirecting to its alter-repository:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### ✈️ [aircraftmodel.eu](https://aircraftmodel.eu)

**→** [`Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel`](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel)

Aviation decarbonization · Hydrogen-electric propulsion · Blended wing body airframes · Certification-grade digital baselines

The **AMPEL360 Q100** lives here — a ~100-passenger regional BWB aircraft concept with H₂ PEM fuel cells, distributed propulsion, and a full OPT-IN Framework scaffold across 79 ATA chapters.

This is aircraft-level truth: structures, systems, operations, circularity.

**IDEALE pillars touched:** A (primary), E (LH₂ propulsion), L (supply chain / DPP), I (S1000D / CSDB)

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### 🛰️ [aerospacemodel.com](https://aerospacemodel.com)

**→** [`Amedeopelliccia/aerospacemodel`](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aerospacemodel)

Space-quantum infrastructure · Manufacturing technology layers · AQUA-V programme · GAIA constellation systems · GAIA-AIR / QAOS

Where the aircraft domain ends, the space and quantum domain begins. Orbital logistics, quantum-classical bridge architectures, synthetic data validation, the manufacturing pipeline that connects design to material reality, and the **GAIA-AIR** ecosystem with its Quantum Aerospace Operating System (**QAOS**) — where NBT gates bridge classical telemetry into quantum-augmented structural analysis, digital twins, and predictive maintenance.

**IDEALE pillars touched:** A (primary), I (quantum-classical data, NBT substrate), D (dual-use awareness), L (manufacturing pipelines)

</td>
</tr>
</table>

The two domains share a strict governance boundary defined in the [IDEALEeu Domain Bifurcation Charter](https://github.com/Amedeopelliccia/aircraftmodel): aircraftmodel.eu handles aviation decarbonization; aerospacemodel.com handles space-quantum infrastructure. The frameworks below are the common spine that both domains inherit.

### What I'm Building

The common engineering spine across all IDEALE pillars:

**OPT-IN Framework** — a 5-axis topology (**O**rganizations, **P**rograms, **T**echnologies, **I**nfrastructures, **N**eural Networks) that organizes every artefact, every uncertainty, and every incentive in a programme into a single navigable structure. The **N-axis** is operationally defined by **NBT gates** — Neural Network Bridging and Tunneling connections that link classical computer interface outputs with quantum-augmented complex manifestations.

**PATH → MTL** — a traceable pipeline (**P**rompting → **A**pproved → **T**emplate → **H**eading → **T**o **M**odel → **T**EKNIA **L**edger) that governs how artefacts are produced, accepted, registered, and rewarded. Every piece of engineering evidence — whether created by a human analyst or an AI operator — follows the same pipeline.

**DWGE** — a Deterministic Widget Generator Engine that sits in front of PATH → MTL, normalizing raw prompts into locked intents before any procedure executes. The LLM proposes; the deterministic kernel disposes. Nothing enters the model baseline without passing acceptance gates.

**Teknia Tokens (TT)** — the native instrument of the Economy pillar. Contributors are rewarded for reducing uncertainty: effort + impact, weighted and hash-chained. You close a KNOT, you earn TT. The ledger is the evidence, the incentive, and the audit trail in one structure. TT transforms governed production into transferable value — making the ecosystem self-sustaining.

**Economy (Digital) — the E₂ pillar** — the structured value exchange layer that makes IDEALE self-sustaining. It defines first-class economic objects: Contribution Assets, Evidence Packages, Qualified Models, Certification Bundles, DPP Assets, and Tokenized Recognition Units. These are not speculative instruments — they are governed, audited, and anchored to certified impact. The Economy pillar enables: markets for qualified models and sovereign datasets, markets for approved procedures, contribution scoring based on verified impact (not likes, not stars — auditable uncertainty reduction), and reputation derived from ledger-anchored evidence. This is industrial digital economy: governed by ESG constraints, interoperable with Gaia-X, and aligned with European regulation.

**IDEALE Portal — European Industrial Asset Exchange** — the interface layer between engineering truth and European capital allocation. The portal is not a repository host — it is a regulated innovation marketplace for certified industrial assets. Its primary object is the **Industrial Asset** (hydrogen propulsion architectures, certified procedures, qualified AI models, DPP-compliant supply chain modules), each carrying TRL level, compliance map, lifecycle phase, evidence packages, export classification, and ESG footprint. The portal serves two sides: **innovators** (structured asset registration, governance rails, impact scoring, call visibility) and **EU programmes / capital** (filterable maturity views, risk classification, compliance readiness, evidence audit packs). The funding logic flips: instead of proposals seeking calls, asset maturity auto-matches open calls, generates proposal skeletons from existing artefacts, and shows the readiness delta. This reduces proposal fiction and increases engineering truth. The portal sits between GitHub (technical infrastructure), CORDIS/Horizon (policy), EIB/EBI (capital), and certification authorities (EASA). It does not replace them — it orchestrates visibility. The portal's five-layer architectural stack: (1) Asset Registry — typed artefacts, metadata, lifecycle; (2) Governance Engine — gates, traceability, contribution mapping; (3) Compliance Modules — EU AI Act, CS-25, DPP, export control; (4) Funding Interface — call database integration, readiness scoring, proposal scaffolding; (5) Economic Layer — contribution valuation, impact scoring, structured recognition. The critical differentiator: IDEALE optimizes for admissibility, traceability, maturity, capital efficiency, and regulatory alignment — not speed, openness, or popularity. It is infrastructure for serious industrial innovation. Initial architecture: federated index layer with structured metadata + governance overlay. You do not fight GitHub — you extend it.

**Trace Threads, Responsibility Chairs, and Capillary Merit** — the operational mechanics that make the portal auditable. A **TraceThread** (TTD) is a first-class typed, immutable chain connecting intent → procedure → artefact → evidence → gate decision → baseline, plus contributors, approvers, and accountable roles. A **ResponsibilityChair** is a governance slot bound to scope (programme, ATA, lifecycle phase, artifact type) with authority level, delegation rules, signature policy, and conflict policy — the chair persists when people change, ensuring audit continuity. **Capillary Merit** is the mechanism that makes invisible innovators visible: merit accrues not from commits but from gate-validated uncertainty reduction. The **Capillary Merit Index** (CMI) scores each contribution event by type, criticality, uncertainty reduction ($\Delta U$), and admissibility classification — merit only mints when the artefact is thread-anchored and gate-validated. People who close trace loops, add BREX rules, validate datasets, resolve export classifications, or improve reproducibility earn structural recognition. Not likes. Not stars. Verified impact.

**NBT Gates (Neural Network Bridging and Tunneling)** — the operational definition of the N-axis. NBT gates are the connections that link classical computer interface outputs — the deterministic artefacts produced by DWGE and registered through PATH → MTL — with quantum-augmented complex manifestations: simplicial state spaces, persistent homology computations, and higher-order topological inference executed on quantum processing units. Where DWGE freezes semantic state, NBT gates freeze topological state. Where PATH → MTL projects intent onto admissible trajectories in the classical domain, NBT gates bridge that projection into quantum-accelerated manifolds and tunnel results back as geometrically structured evidence. The gate layer is realized through Quantum Simplicial Neural Networks (QSNs), persistent homology pipelines, and the GAIA-AIR / QAOS ecosystem.

These are not aerospace-specific tools. They are governance, computation, and economic primitives that work wherever artefact production must be deterministic, traceable, fair, and self-sustaining — and wherever data relationships must be captured in their full topological complexity. The aerospace pillar is where they are first instantiated — but the architecture is designed for any IDEALE pillar to adopt them.

---

### What Drives This

Aircraft are the most documented machines on Earth. Every bolt has a part number, every procedure has a data module, every modification has a traceability chain. I work inside that documentation ecosystem professionally — and I've seen how the gap between engineering truth and published deliverables creates friction, ambiguity, and lost knowledge.

The frameworks here are my attempt to close that gap structurally: not by adding more documents, but by making the *process of producing documents* deterministic, traceable, and fair.

Fair to the people who do the work. Fair to the third parties whose ideas inform ours. Fair to the operators who depend on what we publish being correct. Fair across borders.

That is the European intelligence I want to found: not surveillance, but structural clarity. Not control, but governed openness. An inclusive model that can be adopted, adapted, and exported — because its architecture is invariant while its content is extensible.

---

### Contribution Philosophy

I operate under a governed recognition framework. External intellectual contributions — whether public domain references, licensed datasets, conceptual inspirations, or direct co-authorship — are explicitly declared, categorized (C1–C6), and ledger-anchored. Design authority is retained; attribution is never erased.

Recognition without dilution. Sovereignty without exclusion. Collaboration without loss of structural authorship.

This is the **S** in ESG made operational.

---

## Part I — Foundational Primitives

> *These primitives define the mathematical objects that OPT-IN (`§OPT-IN`) implements, that PATH → MTL (`§STD`) operates on, that the IDEALE pillar structure (`§IDEALE`) decomposes across domains, and that NBT gates (`§NBT`) bridge into quantum-augmented computation.*

### 1. Minimum Common Denominator (Open Aggregator)

> The minimal invariant structural core that enables interoperability while remaining extensible.

**Properties:** structural minimalism, shared constraint layer, open extension surface, deterministic governance, aggregation without fragmentation.

Let systems $S_i$ represent individual system instances. Let $F(S_i)$ denote the invariant structural features extracted from each system.

```math
\text{MCD} = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F(S_i)
```

The core is contained in all systems. Extensions exist outside the invariant core.

**`§OPT-IN` cross-reference:** The OPT-IN 5-axis topology (O-P-T-I-N) *is* the MCD for programme management across any IDEALE pillar. Every programme — whether in Aerospace, Energy, or Defense — instantiates the same five axes; domain-specific content lives in the extension layer. The invariant core guarantees that any two OPT-IN programmes are structurally navigable by the same toolchain.

**`§IDEALE` cross-reference:** IDEALE itself is an MCD at the enterprise level. The six pillars (I·D·E·A·L·E) share a common governance layer (ESG), a common pipeline (PATH → MTL), and a common incentive structure (TT). The pillar-specific content — hydrogen propulsion for Energy, certification evidence for Aerospace, supply chain traceability for Logistics, token-mediated value exchange for Economy — lives in the extension layer. The invariant core is the governance machinery. The Economy pillar converts the outputs of all other pillars into transferable value: uncertainty reduction becomes reward, evidence becomes asset, contribution becomes economic act.

### 2. Programme Outline as MCD System

A programme outline decomposes into invariant core + extension:

```math
M_i = C \oplus E_i
```

Where $C$ = invariant structural core, $E_i$ = module-specific extension, $C \cap E_i = \varnothing$.

| Layer | Content | `§OPT-IN` mapping | `§IDEALE` mapping |
|-------|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Identity (invariant)** | ID, Authority, Scope, Version, Lifecycle | OPT-IN axis headers + ATA chapter identifiers | IDEALE pillar + domain identifier |
| **Functional Core (invariant)** | Purpose, Interfaces, Dependencies, Risks, Compliance | LC01–LC14 lifecycle phases | ESG enforcement layer (E+S+G) |
| **Extension (variable)** | Domain-specific models, parametric analysis, trade studies | Per-ATA SSOT content | Pillar-specific engineering artefacts |

**`§STD` cross-reference:** The PATH → MTL heading block (artifact_id, knot_ref, ata_chapter, lifecycle_phase, procedure_ref, prompt_hash, template_version, classification, status) *is* the Identity Layer for every artefact. It is stamped by `WDG-TPL-REFORMAT` (`§3.1a` §7.1, widget #5) before any extension content is written. This heading is pillar-agnostic — the same schema applies whether the artefact belongs to aircraftmodel.eu or aerospacemodel.com.

### 3. Simplicial Partitioning of Possibility Space

Define state vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Admissible set:

```math
\mathcal{F} = \{x \mid g_i(x) \le 0,\ h_j(x)=0\}
```

Partition domain into simplices:

```math
\Omega = \bigcup_{\sigma \in K} \sigma
```

Classify simplices:

- **Fully admissible** — entire simplex lies within $\mathcal{F}$
- **Mixed boundary** — partial intersection with $\mathcal{F}$
- **Inadmissible** — no intersection with $\mathcal{F}$

Admissible subcomplex:

```math
\mathcal{F} \approx \bigcup_{\sigma \in K_{\text{adm}}} \sigma
```

**Structural benefits:** enumerability, local linear reasoning, adjacency graph, transition control.

**`§LC01` cross-reference:** Each KNOT corresponds to a mixed-boundary simplex — a region of the design space where admissibility is uncertain. The KNOT lifecycle (OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → CLOSED) is the process of resolving a mixed simplex into either $K_\text{adm}$ (closed with evidence) or $K_\text{inadm}$ (rejected). KNUs are the evidence artefacts that move a simplex from mixed to classified. The residual uncertainty score (0–100) in `KNOTS.csv` is a discretized measure of the mixed-boundary fraction.

**`§NBT` cross-reference:** The simplicial partitioning described here is not merely an abstract mathematical model — it has a computational realization through NBT gates. Each 0-simplex corresponds to a *NeuronBit* (a fundamental simplicial anchor unit) that the N-axis can bridge into quantum-augmented processing. When NeuronBit nodes combine under simplicial rules, they form the same $k$-simplices described above: 1-simplices encode pairwise relationships, 2-simplices encode three-body interactions, and higher-order simplices capture the multi-way correlations that classical graph representations lose. The admissible subcomplex $K_\text{adm}$ is therefore not just a mathematical set — it is a physically addressable structure that can cross NBT gates, where persistent homology and Betti number extraction execute via quantum parallel construction and tunnel back as gated evidence (see [Part IIIb](#part-iiib--nbt-gates-neural-network-bridging-and-tunneling)).

### 4. Voluntad as Directional Operator

Admissibility defines *permitted states*. Voluntad defines *direction of evolution*.

Objective functional $J(x)$. Constrained dynamic:

```math
\dot{x} = \Pi_{\mathcal{F}}(\nabla J(x))
```

On the simplicial adjacency graph:

```math
\sigma_0 \rightarrow \sigma_1 \rightarrow \dots
```

maximizing $J$ under the admissibility constraint.

Voluntad operates on position within the feasible manifold and on evolution of the constraint structure itself.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** PATH → MTL *is* the projection operator $\Pi_\mathcal{F}$. The pipeline constrains the gradient of intent (raw prompt → locked intent → approved procedure → templated artefact → gated acceptance → registered model → ledger entry). At no point can the system move outside $\mathcal{F}$ — that is the Monotonic Safety Property (MSP):

```math
S(T(B)) \geq S(B) \quad \text{and} \quad R(T(B)) \geq R(B)
```

or the tool refuses execution. The DWGE intent-lock (`§3.1a` §4.2) is the first enforcement point: nothing enters PATH until intent is frozen. The acceptance gates (`§STD`) are the second: nothing enters SSOT/PUB unless all gates pass. Together they guarantee that the system only moves along admissible trajectories.

**`§IDEALE` cross-reference:** The Voluntad functional $J$ is not purely technical. Across the IDEALE pillars, it encodes: environmental impact minimization (**E**SG), social fairness in attribution (**S** — `§3.1b`), governance integrity (**G** — MSP + gate invariants), and economic sustainability through value transfer (**E** — Economy, via TT incentives and evidence markets). The projection $\Pi_\mathcal{F}$ therefore enforces not just technical admissibility but ESG admissibility and economic viability at every step.

---

## Part II — Constrained Evolution (PATH → MTL as Projected Dynamics)

> *This section formalizes the relationship between the mathematical model in Part I and the pipeline mechanics defined in `§STD` and `§3.1a`.*

### 5. The Pipeline as Projection

The full pipeline composes as:

```math
\text{RAW} \xrightarrow{\text{DWGE}} \text{IntentSpec} \xrightarrow{\Pi_\mathcal{F}} \text{Artefact} \xrightarrow{\text{Gates}} \text{SSOT/PUB}
```

| Pipeline stage | Mathematical role | `§STD` / `§3.1a` reference |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| RAW prompt | Unconstrained gradient $\nabla J(x)$ | Human or automated trigger |
| WDG-INTENT-PARSE (#1) | Project onto candidate feasible directions | `§3.1a` §4.2, state: INTERPRET |
| WDG-INTENT-CONFIRM (#2) | Lock direction (freeze IntentSpec) | `§3.1a` §4.2, state: CONFIRM |
| WDG-PROC-MATCH (#3) | Verify direction lies within procedure envelope | `§3.1a` §7.1, PATH stage A |
| WDG-TPL-SELECT (#4) | Select canonical coordinate frame | `§3.1a` §7.1, PATH stage T |
| WDG-TPL-REFORMAT (#5) | Transform into canonical representation | `§3.1a` §6.2, reformat decision |
| Operator execution | Compute step along constrained trajectory | PATH stage H |
| WDG-CHECK-COMPLETENESS (#6) | Verify step is well-defined | PATH stage → TO, GATE-COMPLETENESS |
| WDG-BREX-VALIDATE (#7) | Verify S1000D boundary conditions (PUB only) | PATH stage → TO, GATE-BREX |
| WDG-CONTRIBUTION-MAP (#10) | Verify provenance and attribution | `§3.1b` §6, GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED, GATE-IP-CLEAR |
| WDG-REGISTER-MODEL (#8) | Commit to configuration baseline | PATH stage → M |
| WDG-LEDGER-WRITE (#9) | Hash-chain provenance record | PATH stage → L, TEKNIA ledger |

**10 widgets. 8 gates. 2 touch LLM. 8 deterministic. 1 optional LLM. The system is closed.**

### 6. Monotonic Safety Property (MSP)

The aggregated GenAI layer SHALL operate under a monotonic safety constraint such that no artefact entering SSOT or PUB decreases verified safety margins, traceability completeness, or regulatory compliance relative to the certified baseline.

**Guaranteed by architecture, not by LLM behaviour:**

| Containment mechanism | `§STD` enforcement point |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| No direct baseline mutation | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL requires all gates passed |
| Constraint envelope guard | WDG-PROC-MATCH verifies against `constraints_envelope` |
| Margin preservation | GATE-BOUNDS-CHECK enforces numerical ranges |
| Traceability integrity | GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE verifies all cross-references |
| Hash chain continuity | GATE-HASH-INTEGRITY verifies `prev_tx_hash` |
| No non-admissible state jumps | IntentSpec confirmation policy (`§3.1a` §5.3) |

### 7. Qualification Target

> Don't qualify GenAI. Qualify GenAI *usage*.

The Qualified System-of-Tools (QSOT) = the aggregated governance layer:

| QSOT component | `§STD` location |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Intent lock layer | `§3.1a` — DWGE (widgets #1–2 + confirmation policy) |
| Approved procedure registry | `.path_mtl/procedures/PROCEDURE_INDEX.csv` |
| Canonical templates | `.path_mtl/templates/TEMPLATE_INDEX.csv` |
| Acceptance gates | `.path_mtl/gates/GATE_INDEX.csv` |
| Model registration rules | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL (#8) |
| Ledger / provenance | WDG-LEDGER-WRITE (#9) + `ledger.json` |
| Replay harness | `§3.1a` §10 — conformance tests |
| Contribution governance | `§3.1b` — CLL (widget #10 + gates) |

The LLM is a bounded inference component whose outputs are never accepted without deterministic controls. The foundation model is under configuration control but is not the qualified element.

**Q-criterion:** A GenAI-enabled pipeline is qualifiable if, for any prompt $p$, either the pipeline returns REJECT/ESCALATE, or it returns an artefact $a$ such that: (1) $a$ conforms to template + schema, (2) all gates pass deterministically, (3) $a$ is fully traceable to frozen intent and procedure version, (4) the decision record is replayable.

## Part III — Certification State Space

> *This section formalizes the simplex classification model and maps it to the gate system defined in `§STD`.*

### 8. Simplex Classification

Let $\sigma = \text{conv}\{v_0, \dots, v_d\}$. Let admissibility be $A(x)$ and feasible set $\mathcal{F} = \{x : A(x) = \text{true}\}$.

Three Boolean tests:

- **Vertex feasibility:** $V(\sigma) = \bigwedge_k A(v_k)$
- **Existence feasibility:** $E(\sigma) = \exists\, x \in \sigma : A(x)$
- **Full inclusion:** $I(\sigma) = \forall\, x \in \sigma : A(x)$

| Class | Condition | `§LC01` mapping |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Fully admissible | $I(\sigma)$ | KNOT status = CLOSED, residual ≤ target |
| Inadmissible | $\neg E(\sigma)$ | KNOT closed as REJECTED (infeasible) |
| Mixed boundary | $E(\sigma) \land \neg I(\sigma)$ | KNOT status = OPEN or IN_PROGRESS |

### 9. Resolution Policies

| Policy | Rule | `§STD` mapping | When to use |
|--------|------|----------------|-------------|
| **A — Fail-Closed** | Accept only $K_\text{full}$; reject mixed until refined | Release / certification baseline | Early certification, safety-critical, sparse evidence |
| **B — Inner-Approximation** | Compute safe polytope $\sigma_\text{safe} \subset \sigma \cap \mathcal{F}$ | GATE-BOUNDS-CHECK clipping | Continuity of design search with no unsafe leakage |
| **C — Conditional** | Mixed → admissible iff evidence conditions $C_m$ satisfied | KNU acceptance gates | Innovation boundary with SC/AMC/MoC |
| **D — Probabilistic** | Not for certification claims | Exploration only | Internal trade studies, surrogate models |

Conditional admissibility:

```math
A(x) = A_0(x) \land \bigwedge_m \bigl(\text{if } C_m(x) \text{ then } A_m(x)\bigr)
```

Sub-classifications:

- **Admissible (conditional):** feasible iff evidence packages satisfied → `KNU.status = COMPLETE`
- **Admissible (probationary):** prototype/experimental envelope only → `KNU.status = IN_PROGRESS`
- **Not admissible:** missing/failed evidence gates → `KNU.status = PLANNED` (blocked)

**`§STD` cross-reference:** The 4 blocked KNUs identified in the TLAR programme (KNOT-TLAR-01-005, -05-006, -08-005, -10-001) are mixed-boundary simplices under Policy C. They become admissible only when their procedure-qualification KNOTs are closed — which is exactly what WDG-PROC-MATCH (`§3.1a` §7.1) enforces at the A-stage gate.

### 10. Three-Set Partition (Implementation)

Maintain three simplex sets at each time step:

| Set | Purpose | `§STD` mapping | Certification use |
|-----|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| $K_\text{full}(t)$ | Fully admissible | KNOT CLOSED + all gates PASS | Release / certification baseline |
| $K_\text{cond}(t)$ | Conditionally admissible | KNOT IN_PROGRESS + evidence gates open | Requires evidence closure |
| $K_\text{explore}$ | Exploration only | No KNOT registered; DEV-class artefacts | Never for certification claims |

**Deterministic invariants:**

| ID | Rule | `§STD` enforcement |
|----|------|-------------------|
| INV-001 | No certification claim may reference any simplex outside $K_\text{full}(t)$ | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL blocks non-gated artefacts |
| INV-002 | State transitions must be monotone unless a regulatory rollback event is recorded with `regulatory_event_id` + `signed_approval` | GATE-HASH-INTEGRITY + ledger immutability |
| INV-003 | Every gate requires `evidence_refs[]`, `approvals[]`, and `run_manifest_ref` before closing | Gate schema in `.path_mtl/gates/` |

### 11. Evidence-Gated State Machine

For each mixed simplex $\sigma$ (equivalently, each KNOT):

```
MIXED ──[moc_pkg]──▶ CONDITIONAL ──[evidence approved]──▶ FULL
  │                         │
  ├──[refine]───────────────┘
  └──[refine]──▶ INADMISSIBLE

        CONDITIONAL ──[evidence fail]──▶ REJECTED

Rollbacks (require regulatory_event_id + signed_approval):
  FULL ──[regulatory_rollback]──▶ CONDITIONAL
  CONDITIONAL ──[regulatory_rollback]──▶ MIXED
```

**`§LC01` cross-reference:** This state machine is the KNOT lifecycle:

| State machine state | KNOT status | KNU status | Residual |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| MIXED | OPEN | PLANNED | 100 |
| CONDITIONAL | IN_PROGRESS | IN_PROGRESS / COMPLETE | 100 > R > target |
| FULL | CLOSED | ACCEPTED | R ≤ target |
| INADMISSIBLE | CLOSED (rejected) | N/A | N/A |

TT distribution occurs only at FULL transition. The formula from `§LC01`:

```math
w_i = \alpha \cdot \hat{E}_i + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \hat{I}_i \quad;\quad T_i = P_k \cdot w_i
```

### 12. Time-Dependent Constraint Dynamics

```math
\mathcal{F}(t) = \{x \in \Omega : A(x,t) = \text{true}\}
```

Decomposition:

```math
A(x,t) = A_\text{hard}(x,t) \land A_\text{soft}(x,t) \land A_\text{evidence}(x,t)
```

| Layer | Description | Evolution driver | `§STD` mapping |
|-------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Hard** | Statutes, fundamental safety requirements | Rarely relaxed | CS-25 / FAR Part 25 constraints |
| **Soft** | AMC/GM, interpretive guidance, MoC ranges | Regulators | Special Conditions, CRI responses |
| **Evidence** | TRL, test coverage, approved analyses | Programme maturity | KNU artefacts closing KNOTs |

Change event stream:

```math
\Delta K_\text{adm}^{+} = K_\text{adm}(t+\Delta t) \setminus K_\text{adm}(t) \qquad \text{(gains — cells become admissible)}
```
```math
\Delta K_\text{adm}^{-} = K_\text{adm}(t) \setminus K_\text{adm}(t+\Delta t) \qquad \text{(losses — rare, regulatory rollback)}
```

Regulatory expansion:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{aero}(t+\Delta t) = \mathcal{F}_\text{aero}(t) \cup \Delta\mathcal{F}_\text{SC/AMC} \cup \Delta\mathcal{F}_\text{evidence}
```

**`§STD` cross-reference:** Each $\Delta\mathcal{F}_\text{evidence}$ event corresponds to a KNU reaching ACCEPTED status. The ledger (`WDG-LEDGER-WRITE`, widget #9) records the timestamp, artefact hash, and gate results — creating an auditable time-series of $K_\text{adm}(t)$ evolution.

---

## Part IIIb — NBT Gates (Neural Network Bridging and Tunneling)

> *This section formalizes NBT gates (`§NBT`) as the operational definition of the N-axis in OPT-IN. Where Parts I–III define the simplicial state space and its constrained evolution within the classical governance domain, Part IIIb defines the gate layer that bridges classical interface outputs into quantum-augmented complex manifolds and tunnels results back. The NeuronBit — a simplicial anchor unit — is the fundamental data structure that flows through NBT gates.*

### 13. NBT Gates — N-Axis Operational Definition

In the OPT-IN 5-axis topology, the first four axes (O-P-T-I) produce classical artefacts governed by deterministic pipelines. The fifth axis — **N (Neural Networks)** — is where the architecture crosses the classical-quantum boundary. NBT gates are the connections at that boundary.

**NBT** = **N**eural Network **B**ridging and **T**unneling.

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Bridging** | Classical interface outputs (registered artefacts, locked IntentSpecs, gated evidence) are translated into quantum state preparations and injected into simplicial complexes on the QPU |
| **Tunneling** | Quantum-augmented results (persistent homology invariants, Betti numbers, topological classifications) are mapped back into geometric structures that the classical pipeline can consume without inducing decoherent collapse |
| **Gate** | The deterministic boundary control — nothing crosses from classical to quantum or back without satisfying the same gate invariants (INV-001–003) that govern classical registration |

The **NeuronBit** (the simplicial unit that flows through NBT gates) is structured not as a scalar (classical bit), not as a probability amplitude (qubit), but as a **topological anchor point** in a simplicial complex:

| Property | Classical bit | Qubit | NeuronBit (simplicial unit) |
|----------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| State | Deterministic: $\{0, 1\}$ | Superposition: $\alpha\|0\rangle + \beta\|1\rangle$ | Simplicial: node in $K$ with adjacency, boundary, and coboundary operators |
| Relationships | Pairwise (edges in flat graphs) | Entangled pairs/registers | Higher-order ($n$-simplices for $n$-body interactions) |
| Context | Inferred *a posteriori* (joins, lookups) | Encoded in entanglement structure | **Intrinsic** — the topology *is* the context |
| Persistence | RAM / register | Coherence-limited | Topologically persistent (survives across filtration scales) |

**`§OPT-IN` cross-reference:** Each ATA chapter node in the OPT-IN topology is a 0-simplex (NeuronBit anchor). Cross-chapter dependencies (e.g. ATA 28 fuel ↔ ATA 24 electrical power ↔ ATA 71 power plant) form higher-order simplices. The OPT-IN structure *is* a simplicial complex. The four classical axes (O-P-T-I) produce artefacts that populate this complex; the N-axis (NBT gates) bridges the complex into quantum-augmented processing and tunnels invariants back.

**`§3.1a` cross-reference:** The DWGE intent-lock freezes *semantic* state before classical pipeline execution. NBT gates freeze *topological* state before quantum execution. Both are projection operators that prevent uncontrolled state mutation — DWGE at the governance layer, NBT at the computation layer. The combined architecture: DWGE → PATH → MTL → **NBT gate (bridge)** → QPU → **NBT gate (tunnel)** → classical registration.

### 14. Bridging and Tunneling Mechanics

The NBT gate operates bidirectionally across the classical-quantum boundary:

```math
\underbrace{\text{O-P-T-I}}_{\text{classical axes}} \xrightarrow[\text{BRIDGE}]{\text{NBT gate}} \underbrace{\text{QPU (simplicial manifold)}}_{\text{quantum-augmented}} \xrightarrow[\text{TUNNEL}]{\text{NBT gate}} \underbrace{\text{N-axis registration}}_{\text{classical evidence}}
```

**Bridge path** (classical → quantum):

1. PATH → MTL produces a registered artefact (e.g. structural sensor data, KNOT evidence complex, TLAR parameter set)
2. NBT gate translates the artefact into a simplicial state preparation — encoding NeuronBit anchor points, their adjacency operators, and boundary/coboundary maps as quantum states
3. QPU receives the prepared state and processes it in quantum parallelism (superposition of all $k$-simplices)

**Tunnel path** (quantum → classical):

1. QPU computation produces a probabilistic distribution (topological invariants, Betti numbers, persistent homology diagrams)
2. NBT gate maps the distribution back into a multidimensional geometric structure — not raw quantum measurement, but a topologically coherent result that preserves the simplicial relationships
3. The result enters the classical N-axis as a gated evidence artefact, subject to the same INV-001–003 invariants as any SSOT/PUB registration

This resolves the critical **temporal synchronization** problem: classical circuits operate at GHz clock speeds; quantum gate times (trapped ions, superconducting circuits) are orders of magnitude slower; entanglement lifetimes are fleeting. The NBT gate's topological persistence bridges the timescale gap by preserving geometric coherence across the computation lifecycle — the simplicial structure is the synchronization medium.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** The bridge path is equivalent to a `WDG-TPL-REFORMAT` transformation from classical artefact schema into simplicial state schema. The tunnel path is equivalent to `WDG-CHECK-COMPLETENESS` + `WDG-REGISTER-MODEL` on the returning quantum evidence. The same pipeline mechanics apply — the domain changes from semantic to topological, but the governance is invariant.

### 15. Information Threads and Persistent Homology (Quantum-Side Processing)

On the quantum side of the NBT gate, connected NeuronBit simplices form **information threads** — continuous topological trajectories that encode not just data values but the geometric relationships between them. This is what the QPU operates on after the bridge.

The analytical framework for extracting invariants from these threads is **persistent homology**. It tracks the birth and death of topological features (connected components, holes, voids) across filtration scales $\epsilon$:

```math
H_k(K_{\epsilon_1}) \rightarrow H_k(K_{\epsilon_2}) \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow H_k(K_{\epsilon_n})
```

The key invariants are the **Betti numbers** $\beta_k$:

- $\beta_0$ = number of connected components (clusters of related data)
- $\beta_1$ = number of 1-dimensional holes (information gaps, missing evidence loops)
- $\beta_2$ = number of 2-dimensional voids (enclosed regions of uncertainty)
- $\beta_k$ = higher-dimensional topological features

**Classical bottleneck:** Computing persistent homology classically requires $O(2^n)$ memory for the Vietoris-Rips filtration — exponential scaling that makes large-scale topological analysis intractable.

**Quantum acceleration via NBT:** The architecture offloads topological analysis to the quantum domain in two steps:

1. **Parallel simplicial state construction** — Grover-accelerated construction of quantum states encoding all $k$-simplices in superposition, requiring $\log m$ qubits (exponentially fewer than classical bits) and $O(\zeta^{-1/2} n^2 \log m)$ time.

2. **Betti number extraction via quantum phase estimation** — The Betti numbers correspond to kernel dimensions of the combinatorial Laplacian. Continuous-variable phase estimation on the Dirac operator produces probability distributions whose peaks directly reveal the topological invariants.

**`§LC01` cross-reference:** In the KNOT uncertainty model, a $\beta_1 > 0$ (persistent hole) in the evidence complex for a given ATA node signals an **unresolved information gap** — a loop of dependencies where no KNU has yet closed the cycle. This is a mathematical formalization of what the KNOT register captures as `Status: OPEN` with `Residual > target`. The NBT architecture makes this detection computable in polynomial quantum time rather than exponential classical time.

### 16. Quantum Simplicial Neural Networks (QSNs) — Execution on the Quantum Side

The algorithmic execution layer for data that has crossed the NBT bridge is the **Quantum Simplicial Neural Network (QSN)**. QSNs extend quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) from pairwise interactions to higher-order simplicial processing.

Architecture: a QSN is a sequential stack of **Quantum Simplicial Layers (QSLs)** followed by a classical MLP readout.

| QSL variant | Mechanism | Generalization | Optimal use |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **BQSL** (Base) | Ising-inspired interactions encoding node-node, node-edge, edge-edge correlations | Generalizes to arbitrary dimensional simplices | Full-complex topological feature extraction |
| **SQSL** (Schematic) | Hyperlocal abstraction with high precision | Limited to lower-order simplices | Targeted feature extraction with high accuracy |

Both variants use **Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)** — parameterized quantum gates optimized iteratively by a classical processor to minimize a task-specific loss function.

**Performance:** Empirical results on synthetic classification tasks show QSNs systematically outperform classical topological deep learning models in both inferential accuracy and computational efficiency — validating the practical viability of combining quantum parallelism with simplicial data structures.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** Within the PATH → MTL pipeline, QSN inference is invoked on the quantum side of the NBT bridge. Results tunnel back through NBT gates as topological evidence — for example, gap detection at the `WDG-CHECK-COMPLETENESS` stage (#6) identifying missing evidence threads across the simplicial complex before registration. The Q-criterion (`§3.1a` §7) governs the qualification of QSN-based gate checks: the QSN is a bounded inference component whose outputs must pass deterministic gates before entering the classical baseline.

### 17. GAIA-AIR and QAOS — N-Axis Aerospace Realization

The most concrete implementation of NBT gates is **GAIA-AIR** and its **Quantum Aerospace Operating System (QAOS)** — a full N-axis instantiation where classical aerospace telemetry crosses into quantum-augmented structural analysis and tunnels back as operational evidence:

| GAIA-AIR module | NBT gate function | Operational function |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **QAOS** (operating system) | CPU/QPU bridge+tunnel via NeuronBit information threads | Quantum-classical orchestration, data flow traceability |
| **Robbbo-T / Ampel** | Sensor data bridged to 0-simplices (NeuronBit nodes) on QPU | Topological anomaly detection for predictive maintenance |
| **Digital twin** | Persistent homology tunneled back as structural evidence | Real-time structural monitoring; anomaly = topological void |
| **QPS** (Quantum Propulsion System) | Multi-body fluid dynamics bridged via higher-order simplices | Thrust optimization, CFD acceleration |
| **TerraQueUeing GreenTech** | Topological noise correction as "polarization mapping" | Energy-efficient quantum resource scheduling; ESG-aligned |

**Predictive maintenance via NBT gates:** Instead of classical threshold-based wear monitoring, the digital twin bridges structural sensor data across NBT gates to compute persistent homology on the QPU. A material anomaly manifests as a **topological void** ($\beta_2$ increase) in the structural simplicial complex — detectable before physical failure. The result tunnels back as a gated evidence artefact, triggering maintenance action through the classical O-P-T-I axes.

**`§IDEALE` cross-reference:** GAIA-AIR instantiates multiple IDEALE pillars simultaneously: **A** (aerospace platform), **I** (NBT data architecture), **E** (green quantum scheduling), **L** (material lifecycle traceability via DPP), **E_econ** (KNOT closure rewards, evidence valuation for digital twin outputs). The TerraQueUeing GreenTech philosophy — reserving quantum resources surgically for topological extraction while delegating storage and boolean logic to optimized classical infrastructure — embodies the **E** in ESG at the hardware scheduling level.

**Normalization imperative:** NBT gates serve as a **hardware-agnostic topological abstraction layer**. Whether the QPU uses superconducting circuits, trapped ions, neutral atoms, or photonic processors, the classical axes communicate exclusively in simplicial data constraints and information thread specifications — the NBT gate handles the translation. This is the same normalization philosophy that S1000D provides for technical publications, OPT-IN provides for programme structure, and DWGE provides for semantic intent: a common interface standard that makes the underlying implementation swappable without disrupting governance.

---

## Part IV — Civil-Aerospace Embedding and IDEALE Pillar Coupling

> *This section formalizes the relationship between the aerospace design space, the broader civil governance manifold, and the IDEALE pillar structure. S1000D and DPP act as boundary certificates at the interface.*

### 18. Civil System

```math
S_\text{civil} = (P, I, R, B, C)
```

Where $P$ = population parameters, $I$ = infrastructure, $R$ = regulatory framework, $B$ = budgetary constraints, $C$ = cultural-legitimacy parameters.

Admissibility constraints: legal, fiscal, capacity, stability.

### 19. Civil Aerospace as Submanifold

```math
S_\text{aero} = (A, O, R, I, F)
```

Where $A$ = aircraft & assets, $O$ = operators, $R$ = regulators, $I$ = infrastructure, $F$ = financial structure.

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{aero} = S(x) \land C(x) \land E(x) \land F(x)
```

Safety compliance ∧ certification validity ∧ environmental conformity ∧ financial sustainability.

Key structural relation:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{aero} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_\text{civil}
```

Aerospace is a safety-critical submanifold of civil governance. Transition principle: adjacency-based reform, certification-bounded evolution, no non-admissible state jumps.

### 20. IDEALE Pillar Coupling

The IDEALE pillars are not independent. They interact through shared constraints and interface operators:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{IDEALE}(t) = \bigcap_{p \in \{I,D,E,A,L,E_\text{econ}\}} \mathcal{F}_p(t) \quad \cap \quad \mathcal{F}_\text{ESG}(t)
```

Where each pillar has its own admissible set, and ESG provides the transversal constraint:

| Pillar | State variables | Admissibility constraints | Interface with **A** |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **I — Information** | Data schemas, AI models, publication structures | Data sovereignty, GDPR, deterministic outputs | ATA 46/95/96/97 — information systems, AI/ML, traceability |
| **D — Defense** | Dual-use classification, export status, supply chain clearance | EU Reg. 2021/821, national security review | `§3.1b` §5.2 — export control gates, GATE-IP-CLEAR |
| **E — Energy** | H₂ production, storage, distribution, grid coupling | Safety (ATEX, PED), availability, carbon intensity | ATA 28 (LH₂ fuel), I-axis (H₂ GSE), TLAR energy balance |
| **A — Aerospace** | Aircraft design, certification, operations | CS-25, S1000D, DO-178C, DO-254 | Primary domain |
| **L — Logistics** | Supply chain, manufacturing, end-of-life | DPP Regulation, circular economy, material traceability | LC09 (production), LC14 (circularity), ATA 96 (DPP) |
| **E — Economy** | Contribution assets, evidence packages, qualified models, TT token flows | Auditability, non-speculation, regulatory alignment, Gaia-X interoperability | TEKNIA ledger, KNOT reward pools, contribution scoring, model exchange |

**Cross-pillar coupling constraints** (AMPEL360 Q100 specific):

| Coupling | Pillars | `§OPT-IN` axis | Evidence function |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Airport LH₂ infrastructure readiness | **E** ↔ **A** | **I** — Infrastructures | $\Gamma_\text{H₂-infra}(x_E, x_A, t)$ |
| Dual-use screening of propulsion technology | **D** ↔ **A** | **N** — Neural Networks | GATE-IP-CLEAR via `§3.1b` |
| Supply chain provenance for LH₂ | **L** ↔ **E** | **N** — Neural Networks | $E_\text{dpp}(x,t)$ via ATA 96 |
| AI model qualification for flight systems | **I** ↔ **A** | **T** — Technologies | Q-criterion via `§3.1a` §7 |
| Circular economy compliance | **L** ↔ **A** | **I** — Infrastructures | LC14 + DPP traceability |
| Topological telemetry processing | **I** ↔ **A** | **T** — Technologies | $\beta_k$ extraction via `§NBT` QSN |
| KNOT closure reward distribution | **E_econ** ↔ all | **N** — Neural Networks | TT allocation via $w_i = \alpha \hat{E}_i + (1-\alpha)\hat{I}_i$ |
| Evidence valuation and model exchange | **E_econ** ↔ **I** | **N** — Neural Networks | $V(x) = f(\Delta U, C, R, T)$ |
| Contribution asset recognition | **E_econ** ↔ **L** | **N** — Neural Networks | C1–C6 taxonomy → contribution asset registry |

**`§IDEALE` cross-reference:** The admissible set $\mathcal{F}_\text{IDEALE}$ is the intersection of all pillar constraints plus ESG. The Economy pillar ($E_\text{econ}$) adds a critical dimension: it converts governed artefact production into transferable value. Without it, the system is governed but not self-sustaining. With it, every KNU that closes a KNOT generates not just engineering evidence but an economic event — a contribution asset with auditable provenance. No artefact, in any pillar, enters the model baseline unless it satisfies the governance layer. This is why the standard family (§STD + §3.1a + §3.1b) is pillar-agnostic by design: the pipeline, the gates, and the ledger work the same whether the artefact is a TLAR analysis, a hydrogen safety study, a supply chain traceability record, or a qualified model offered on the evidence market.

### 20b. Economy (Digital) — Value Function and First-Class Objects

The Economy pillar introduces a **value function** that converts governed artefact production into transferable economic value:

```math
V(x) = f(\Delta U,\ C,\ R,\ T)
```

Where:

| Variable | Definition | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| $\Delta U$ | Uncertainty reduction | KNOT residual delta: $R_\text{before} - R_\text{after}$ |
| $C$ | Validated contribution | C1–C6 classification + GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED |
| $R$ | Certified relevance | Gate pass count + cross-pillar citation index |
| $T$ | Verified traceability | Hash-chain depth in TEKNIA ledger + DPP links resolved |

This function is what makes the system self-sustaining. Every KNU that closes a KNOT triggers not just an engineering state transition (mixed → full) but an economic event — a contribution asset with computable value.

**First-class economic objects** defined by the E₂ pillar:

| Object | Definition | Provenance |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Contribution Asset** | Ledger-anchored record of a contributor's verified work, scored by $V(x)$ | `§3.1b` CLL + AWARDS_TT.csv |
| **Evidence Package** | Bundled KNU artefacts that closed a KNOT, with all gate evidence and hash chain | KNOT closure record + `§STD` gate logs |
| **Qualified Model** | A registered model artefact that passed all acceptance gates and is available for reuse | WDG-REGISTER-MODEL + Q-criterion compliance |
| **Certification Bundle** | Aggregated evidence proving a simplex transitioned from $K_\text{cond}$ to $K_\text{full}$ | INV-001 compliance + regulatory signoffs |
| **DPP Asset** | Digital Product Passport entry with full lifecycle traceability | ATA 96 + LC14_RETIREMENT_CIRCULARITY |
| **Tokenized Recognition Unit** | TT allocation record for a specific contribution, hash-chained and immutable | TOKENOMICS_TT.yaml + AWARDS_TT.csv + ledger.json |

**What the Economy pillar is not:**

| Not this | But this |
|----------|----------|
| Speculative | Value anchored to certified uncertainty reduction |
| Anonymous | Every asset traces to a declared contributor via C1–C6 |
| Permissionless | Governed by ESG constraints + acceptance gates |
| Volatility-based | Deterministic scoring via $V(x)$ + ledger immutability |
| Fintech / crypto / e-commerce | Industrial digital economy: audited, regulated, European-aligned |

**`§IDEALE` cross-reference:** The Economy pillar is the structural reason the IDEALE framework is not merely a governance tool but an infrastructure. It transforms the system from *technically coherent* to *self-sustaining*: contributors have incentives, evidence has markets, qualified models are exchangeable, and impact is scored by auditable metrics rather than popularity. The interoperability target is Gaia-X — Europe's federated data infrastructure — ensuring that IDEALE economic objects are recognizable across European industrial ecosystems.

### 21. ESG as Transversal Constraint

ESG is not a reporting layer. It is a structural constraint that binds all IDEALE pillars:

```math
\mathcal{F}_\text{ESG}(t) = \mathcal{F}_E(t) \land \mathcal{F}_S(t) \land \mathcal{F}_G(t)
```

| ESG dimension | Formal constraint | `§STD` enforcement | IDEALE pillars affected |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **E — Environment** | No artefact may degrade lifecycle environmental metrics (emissions, materials, circularity) relative to baseline | LC14 evidence, DPP validation, climate impact gates | E, A, L |
| **S — Social** | No artefact may enter SSOT/PUB without a complete contribution map; no contributor may be erased from the ledger | GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED, `§3.1b` C1–C6 taxonomy | All pillars |
| **G — Governance** | MSP holds; all transitions are monotone, gated, and ledger-anchored; no improvisation past IntentLock | INV-001–003, GATE-HASH-INTEGRITY, confirmation policy | All pillars |

This makes ESG a *structural invariant*, not a *compliance add-on*. It is enforced by the same gate system that enforces safety. It cannot be switched off without disabling the pipeline itself.

### 22. Documentation as Evidence Functions

```math
\Gamma(x,y,t) = \Gamma_0(x,y,t) \land E_\text{doc}(x,t) \land E_\text{dpp}(x,t)
```

| Evidence system | Proves | `§STD` mapping | IDEALE pillar |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **S1000D / ATA** | Maintainability, operational control, procedures, configuration management | PUB/CSDB — DM, PM, DML, BREX, APPLICABILITY | I, A |
| **Digital Product Passport** | Provenance, materials compliance, sustainability, lifecycle traceability | SSOT/LC14_RETIREMENT_CIRCULARITY + ATA 96 (N-axis) | L, E, A |

These are not just publications — they are *boundary certificates* that prove the interface operator $\Gamma$ holds. Without valid documentation, the aircraft cannot be shown to be globally admissible even if its engineering state $x$ lies within $\mathcal{F}_\text{aero}$.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** GATE-BREX validates S1000D boundary conditions. GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE validates that documentation references are complete and resolvable. Together they enforce $E_\text{doc}(x,t)$ at every artefact registration.

---

## Part V — Contribution Governance & Contributions Registry

> *This section aligns with `§3.1b` — the Contribution Ledger Layer (CLL). It encodes the **S** in ESG as operational architecture.*

### 23. Contribution Taxonomy

Per `§3.1b` §3, every external influence is classified into exactly one category:

| Code | Category | Sovereignty impact | Design authority transfer | `§3.1b` ref |
|------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **C1** | Public domain reference | None | None | §3 |
| **C2** | Licensed dataset | Traceable dependency | None | §3 |
| **C3** | Conceptual inspiration | None (sovereign transformation) | None | §3 |
| **C4** | Co-developed procedure | Shared method claim | On procedure only | §3 |
| **C5** | Toolchain integration | No design claim | None | §3 |
| **C6** | Direct artifact co-author | Shared authorship | On specific artifact | §3 |

**Sovereign transformation test** (`§3.1b` §3.1): A contribution is sovereignly transformed when (1) the external input served as inspiration or data source, AND (2) the programme applied its own procedures, templates, and governance, AND (3) the resulting artefact carries original content not present in the source, AND (4) the artefact would exist in substantially the same form with an equivalent source.

**Enforcement:** WDG-CONTRIBUTION-MAP (`§3.1b` §6, widget #10) fires on every SSOT/PUB artefact. GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED blocks registration if external references are detected without a declared contribution map. GATE-IP-CLEAR blocks registration for C4/C6 contributions without IP clearance.

### 24. Programme-Level Declarations

### 25. Contributions Registry — Backend-Auditable Classification

Structured technical classification of contributions by Amedeo Pelliccia, formalized for backend audit.

| ID | Domain | Type | TRL | Cert. relevance | `§STD` component | IDEALE pillar |
|----|--------|------|-----|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| CONTRIB-001 | OPT-IN / Open Architecture | Open structural framework | 2–3 | High | `§OPT-IN` — 5-axis topology + LC01–LC14 | All (MCD) |

| CONTRIB-005 | PATH → MTL Pipeline | Traceable production governance | 2–3 | High | `§STD` — pipeline, gates, ledger | G (ESG core) |
| CONTRIB-006 | Teknia Token Incentive Layer | Hash-chained incentive system | 1–2 | Medium | `§LC01` — TOKENOMICS_TT, AWARDS_TT | E₂ (Economy), S (ESG) |

**Consolidated evaluation:**

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| High formal structuring | Systems with architecture, not isolated ideas |
| Certification orientation | Logic anchored to compliance even at conceptual stage |
| Determinism pursuit | Explicit reduction of semantic and structural ambiguity |
| Multi-domain integration | Aeronautics + documentation + AI + governance + policy |
| Open publication | Intellectual transfer under governed recognition |
| ESG-structural | Environment, Social, Governance encoded as gate constraints, not reporting layers |

**Strategic observation:**

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Structural coherence | High — standard family (§STD + §3.1a + §3.1b) + IDEALE-ESG are self-consistent |
| Institutional formalization | Low — requires industrial adoption, academic collaboration, policy engagement |
| Dependencies | Validated-product transformation, regulatory engagement, toolchain implementation, European institutional anchoring |
| Export potential | High — pillar-agnostic governance, adaptable to non-EU contexts via MCD invariance |

## Part Vb — Portal Architecture (Trace Threads, Responsibility Chairs, Capillary Merit)

> *This section formalizes the operational mechanics of the IDEALE Portal — the European Industrial Asset Exchange. Where Part V defines contribution governance (who contributed what), Part Vb defines the threading, accountability, and merit infrastructure that makes contributions discoverable, auditable, and economically valuable under the E₂ pillar.*

### 26. TraceThread (TTD) — First-Class Trace Object

A TraceThread is a typed, immutable chain that connects an intent to its full lifecycle outcome. It is the fundamental audit unit of the portal.

**Canonical fields** (deterministic, all required for registration):

| Field | Type | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| `thread_id` | Stable unique identifier | System-generated at thread creation |
| `artifact_id` | Target artefact | `§STD` heading block |
| `parent_threads[]` | Lineage / derivations | Structural: every thread references its ancestors |
| `intent_hash` | Frozen intent fingerprint | `§3.1a` DWGE IntentSpec hash |
| `procedure_id`, `procedure_version` | Approved procedure | `§STD` procedure registry |
| `template_id`, `template_version` | Canonical template | `§STD` template registry |
| `gate_run_id` | Gate execution record | `§STD` gate log |
| `gate_results[]` | Pass/fail per gate | Deterministic: COMPLETENESS, BREX, BOUNDS, TRACE, HASH, CONTRIB, IP |
| `evidence_refs[]` | KNUs, tests, datasets, docs | Structural references to SSOT artefacts |
| `responsibility_chair` | Accountable governance slot (role, not person) | See §27 |
| `signatures[]` | Person, organization, timestamp | Cryptographic: who signed, when |
| `contribution_map[]` | C1–C6 declarations | `§3.1b` CLL |
| `prev_thread_hash` | Ledger chain link | TEKNIA ledger: hash of previous thread in sequence |
| `classification` | DEV / COND / FULL | Three-set partition (`§STD` §10) |

**Structural rule:** A TraceThread is queryable and auditable. Every artefact in SSOT/PUB must be reachable from at least one TTD. Orphan artefacts (no thread) are structurally inadmissible.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** The TraceThread subsumes and extends the PATH → MTL heading block. Where the heading block stamps identity on a single artefact, the TTD chains the full provenance: from raw intent through every gate decision to baseline registration and economic valuation. The `prev_thread_hash` field makes the chain immutable — identical in structure to the TEKNIA ledger's `prev_tx_hash`.

### 27. ResponsibilityChair — Auditable Accountability

A ResponsibilityChair is a governance slot bound to scope. It answers: *"Who held accountability for this decision at the time?"* — not *"Who owns the repo now?"*

**Canonical fields:**

| Field | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| `chair_id` | Stable identifier (e.g. `CHAIR-ATA28-BASELINE-AUTH`) |
| `scope` | {programme, ATA chapter, lifecycle phase, artifact type} |
| `authority_level` | `review` / `approve` / `certify` / `release` |
| `delegation_rules` | Who may act on behalf; conditions |
| `signature_policy` | `single` / `dual` / `quorum` |
| `conflict_policy` | What blocks approval (e.g. contributor cannot self-approve) |

**Key principle:** A person occupies a chair for a period; the chair persists across personnel changes. Audits follow the chair, not the individual. The chair is the structural equivalent of the RACI matrix entry — but enforceable, versioned, and immutable in the ledger.

**`§LC01` cross-reference:** The RACI.csv in each LC01_PROBLEM_STATEMENT assigns stakeholder roles (R, A, C, I) to KNOT activities. ResponsibilityChairs formalize the **A** (Accountable) column as a first-class governance object: the chair_id replaces the AoR string with a versioned, ledger-anchored slot that survives personnel rotation.

### 28. Capillary Merit Index (CMI) — Invisible Innovators Made Visible

Merit is not commits. Merit is uncertainty reduction that passed gates.

A **ContributionEvent** is any action that creates or improves an artefact/evidence and is trace-linked (anchored in a TTD). A **MeritUnit** is computed only when a gate accepts the resulting state transition.

**Capillary Merit Index:**

```math
\text{CMI}_i = \sum_{e \in \text{Events}(i)} w_{\text{type}(e)} \cdot w_{\text{crit}(e)} \cdot w_{\Delta U(e)} \cdot w_{\text{adm}(e)}
```

| Weight | Factor | Scale |
|--------|--------|-------|
| $w_\text{type}$ | Event type: fix, evidence, model, procedure, review, trace repair | Defined per programme |
| $w_\text{crit}$ | ATA criticality, safety class, export sensitivity | ATA-derived + D-pillar classification |
| $w_{\Delta U}$ | Uncertainty reduction: KNOT residual drop, test coverage delta, trace closure delta | From KNOTS.csv: $R_\text{before} - R_\text{after}$ |
| $w_\text{adm}$ | Admissibility classification of the target simplex | DEV = 0, COND = 0.5, FULL = 1.0 (or programme policy) |

**Critical rule:** Capillary merit only accrues when the artefact is thread-anchored (TTD exists) + gate-validated (at least one gate passed deterministically). Draft noise — unlinked, ungated work — does not mint merit.

**Who becomes visible:**

| Invisible in GitHub | Visible in IDEALE |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Someone who closes a trace loop (fixes references / applicability) | TRACE-EDGE-RESOLVED event, CMI accrues |
| Someone who adds a BREX rule | GATE-BREX improvement, CMI accrues |
| Someone who validates a dataset or runs an analysis that becomes evidence | EVIDENCE-PACK-ACCEPTED event, CMI accrues |
| Someone who resolves an export-control classification | D-pillar gate closure, CMI accrues |
| Someone who improves reproducibility (run manifest, replay harness) | TRACE-EDGE-ADDED event, CMI accrues |

**`§3.1b` cross-reference:** CMI is the quantitative complement to the C1–C6 qualitative taxonomy. The taxonomy classifies *what kind* of contribution was made; CMI scores *how much impact* it had. Together they form the complete contribution profile that the E₂ pillar converts into a Contribution Asset with computable value via $V(x)$.

### 29. Trace Closure Events — The Only Events That Mint Merit

To make capillary merit auditable, only explicit closure events generate MeritUnits:

| Event type | Definition | Merit effect |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `TRACE-EDGE-ADDED` | New trace link created (satisfies / verifies / derivesFrom) | CMI accrues to contributor |
| `TRACE-EDGE-RESOLVED` | Broken reference fixed | CMI accrues to contributor |
| `KNOT-RESIDUAL-REDUCED` | Quantified uncertainty reduction recorded | CMI accrues proportional to $\Delta U$ |
| `EVIDENCE-PACK-ACCEPTED` | Gate accepts an evidence package | CMI accrues to all contributors in contribution_map |
| `BASELINE-PROMOTED` | Artefact transitions from COND to FULL | CMI multiplier: $w_\text{adm}$ jumps from 0.5 to 1.0 |

Everything else is draft. Only closure events mint economic value.

**`§STD` cross-reference:** These events map directly to gate transitions in the PATH → MTL pipeline. TRACE-EDGE-ADDED = WDG-CHECK-COMPLETENESS resolves a link. EVIDENCE-PACK-ACCEPTED = all gates pass for a KNU. BASELINE-PROMOTED = WDG-REGISTER-MODEL accepts the artefact into $K_\text{full}$.

### 30. Portal Architectural Stack

The IDEALE Portal is structured as a five-layer stack, each layer consuming the governance primitives defined in Parts I–V:

| Layer | Function | `§STD` / `§IDEALE` mapping |
|-------|---------|---------------------------|
| **L1 — Asset Registry** | Typed industrial assets with metadata, lifecycle phase, TRL, compliance map, ESG footprint | OPT-IN topology + ATA chapter identity + LC01–LC14 |
| **L2 — Governance Engine** | Gates, traceability, contribution mapping, responsibility chairs | PATH → MTL pipeline + DWGE + `§3.1b` CLL |
| **L3 — Compliance Modules** | EU AI Act, CS-25 / FAR Part 25, DPP Regulation, EU Reg. 2021/821 (export control) | GATE-BREX + GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE + GATE-IP-CLEAR |
| **L4 — Funding Interface** | Call database integration (Horizon Europe, Clean Aviation, EIC, EIB/EBI), readiness scoring, proposal scaffolding | Asset maturity → call matching → readiness delta → proposal skeleton |
| **L5 — Economic Layer** | Contribution valuation ($V(x)$), CMI scoring, evidence markets, qualified model exchange | E₂ pillar objects + TEKNIA ledger + Gaia-X interoperability |

**Portal positioning:** The IDEALE Portal sits between GitHub (technical infrastructure), CORDIS/Horizon dashboards (policy), EIB/EBI financing instruments (capital), and certification authorities (EASA). It does not replace them. It orchestrates visibility. GitHub tracks commits; IDEALE tracks admissibility.

**Funding logic inversion:** Instead of proposals seeking calls, asset maturity auto-matches open calls. The portal generates structured proposal skeletons from existing artefacts, shows the readiness delta, and indicates missing evidence. This reduces proposal fiction and increases engineering truth.

**Federated architecture:** Initial deployment as a federated index layer with structured metadata + governance overlay. Assets may be hosted in external repositories (GitHub, institutional CSDBs); the portal indexes them with IDEALE metadata, applies gate governance, and exposes them to the funding interface. You do not fight GitHub — you extend it.

**What funders see (machine-readable proof via trace threads):**

| Funder question | Portal answer | Source |
|----------------|--------------|--------|
| What exists? | Asset registry (typed, versioned) | L1 |
| How mature? | LC phase + TRL + evidence count | L1 + TTD.evidence_refs[] |
| What blocks it? | Open KNOTs / missing gates | LC01 KNOTS.csv + TTD.gate_results[] |
| Who is accountable? | Responsibility chairs | TTD.responsibility_chair + §27 |
| Why can it be trusted? | Ledger + replay harness | TTD.prev_thread_hash + `§3.1a` §10 |

This turns funding selection into evidence-based filtering instead of PDF-driven persuasion.

## Structural Synthesis

The complete system is defined by:

```math
(\Omega,\ K,\ \mathcal{F},\ J)
```

Where $\Omega$ = state space, $K$ = simplicial partition, $\mathcal{F}$ = admissible subcomplex, $J$ = Voluntad functional.

Dynamics:

```math
\dot{x} = \Pi_{\mathcal{F}}(\nabla J(x))
```

**The standard family and IDEALE-ESG implement this:**

| Mathematical object | Implementation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| $\Omega$ | IDEALE 6-pillar space × OPT-IN 5-axis topology × 79 ATA chapters |
| $K$ | KNOT register (uncertainty partitioning) |
| $\mathcal{F}$ | Acceptance gates + ESG constraints (deterministic boundary) |
| $J$ | Programme objectives (range, payload, emissions, cost, fairness, sovereignty) |
| $\Pi_\mathcal{F}$ | PATH → MTL pipeline (projection operator) |
| $\nabla J$ | Raw intent (prompts, design goals, policy objectives) |
| $\dot{x}$ | Registered artefacts (constrained trajectory) |
| Provenance of $\dot{x}$ | TEKNIA ledger (hash-chained evidence) |
| Attribution of $\dot{x}$ | Contribution maps (`§3.1b`) |
| Domain decomposition | IDEALE pillars (I·D·E·A·L·E) |
| Transversal constraint | ESG (E·S·G) |
| Value exchange layer | Economy (Digital) — $V(x) = f(\Delta U, C, R, T)$: uncertainty reduction as transferable value |
| Computational substrate | NBT gates (`§NBT`) — bridge classical outputs into quantum manifolds, tunnel invariants back |
| Topological invariants | Betti numbers $\beta_k$ extracted via quantum phase estimation on QPU side of NBT gate |
| Aerospace realization | GAIA-AIR / QAOS — N-axis instantiation: digital twins, QPS, TerraQueUeing |
| Provenance threading | TraceThread (TTD) — immutable chain: intent → procedure → artefact → evidence → gate → baseline |
| Accountability structure | ResponsibilityChairs — governance slots bound to scope, persisting across personnel |
| Merit quantification | Capillary Merit Index (CMI) — uncertainty reduction × criticality × admissibility, gate-minted only |
| Portal stack | IDEALE Portal — L1 Asset Registry, L2 Governance Engine, L3 Compliance, L4 Funding Interface, L5 Economic Layer |

Constraints define stability. Simplices define discrete feasible regions. Voluntad defines direction. Governance defines the projection rule. ESG defines the ethical boundary. IDEALE defines the scope. Economy converts governed production into transferable value. NBT gates bridge it into quantum-augmented computation and tunnel results back.

It is structural logic, not rhetoric.

| Design exploration | Inner-approximation clipping + refinement; never probabilistic for claims | DEV-class artefacts (RULE_2 in `§3.1a` §6.2) |
| Regulatory evolution | Time-index predicates $A(x,t)$; log deltas to $K_\text{full}(t)$ / $K_\text{cond}(t)$ | Ledger time-series |
| Civil–aero coupling | Enforce $\Gamma(x,y,t)$ with S1000D/ATA + DPP as evidence functions | GATE-BREX + GATE-TRACE-RESOLVE |
| Contribution governance | Declare before register; never erase | GATE-CONTRIB-DECLARED + GATE-IP-CLEAR |

## Part VI — 12×12 Intentional Hilbert–Bell Manifold

### 31. Three-Layer Architecture

Three formal levels are distinguished and must be separated with precision:

| Layer | Name | Formal object | Role |
|-------|------|---------------|------|
| 1 | Spatial Discretisation | $\Omega = \bigcup_{i=1}^{N} V_i$ | Partition of the physical domain |
| 2 | State Space (Hilbert) | $L^2(\Omega) \to \mathbb{C}^N$ | Induced state space (not the domain itself) |
| 3 | Physical Field | $H, \boldsymbol{\sigma}, \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ | Operators acting on the state space |

A voxelisation *induces* a finite-dimensional Hilbert space but does not replace it conceptually. The state space is the space of states of the system, not the physical space:

```math
L^2(\Omega) \;\to\; \mathbb{C}^N
```

For $N$ local subsystems with local dimension $d$, the total Hilbert space dimension grows as $\dim(\mathcal{H}_{total}) = d^N$ (exponential). The 12-basis constraint keeps this tractable by limiting the admissible subspace to exactly 12 ontological dimensions.

### 32. Admissible Hilbert Subspace (12-Regime Basis)

```math
\mathcal{H}_{adm} = \text{span}\{|S_1\rangle, \dots, |S_{12}\rangle\}
```

Valid state:

```math
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{k=1}^{12} \alpha_k |S_k\rangle, \quad \Pi_{adm}|\psi\rangle = |\psi\rangle
```

Entanglement topography:

```math
H_{int} = \sum_{i < j} T_{ij}\,|S_i\rangle\langle S_j| + \text{h.c.}
```

Bell-bounded correlation envelope (CHSH):

```math
|B_{ij}| = |\langle A_1 B_1 \rangle + \langle A_1 B_2 \rangle + \langle A_2 B_1 \rangle - \langle A_2 B_2 \rangle| \le 2
```

Intentional Hamiltonian evolution:

```math
i\hbar\,\frac{d|\psi\rangle}{dt} = (H_0 + H_{int} + H_{intent})\,|\psi\rangle
```

After each evolution step the state is projected back onto $\mathcal{H}_{adm}$ via $\Pi_{adm}$.

### 33. Quantum–Classical Boundary — Coherence Reduction Map

The quantum–classical boundary is **not** a geometric surface. It is an information-theoretic reduction:

```math
\mathcal{R}(\rho) = \text{coherence reduction mapping}
```

**Local projection operator** — for each cell $i$:

```math
\mathcal{P}_i : \mathcal{H}_i \to \mathbb{R}^k, \qquad \sigma_{\text{classical}} = \mathrm{Tr}(\rho\,\hat{T})
```

**Decoherence threshold** — a dynamic threshold, not a fixed surface:

```math
\tau_{\text{decoherence}} \ll \tau_{\text{dynamics}} \;\Rightarrow\; \rho \to \text{diagonal}
```

| Regime | Condition | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Quantum | $\tau_{\text{dec}} \ge \tau_{\text{dyn}}$ | Full quantum evolution (Schrödinger / Lindblad) |
| Classical | $\tau_{\text{dec}} \ll \tau_{\text{dyn}}$ | Diagonal density matrix, classical observables only |
| Hybrid | intermediate | Quantum–classical coupling (QM/MM analogue) |

Consistent with: QM/MM (computational chemistry), multiscale quantum embedding, open quantum systems (Lindblad formalism).

### 34. Machine-Readable Specification and Implementation

See [`quantum-manifold.yaml`](quantum-manifold.yaml) for the full specification and [`hilbert_bell_manifold.py`](hilbert_bell_manifold.py) for the Python reference implementation including:

- `SpatialDomain` — Layer 1 discrete partition $\Omega = \bigcup V_i$
- `QuantumState` — Layer 2 normalised state vector in $\mathcal{H}_{adm}$
- `HamiltonianEvolver` — Layer 3 physical field operators on state space
- `CoherenceReductionMap` — $\mathcal{R}(\rho)$ with decoherence threshold classification
- `HilbertBellManifold` — top-level orchestrator integrating all three layers
