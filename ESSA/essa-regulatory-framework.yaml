# 10. Institutional Options
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
institutional_options:
  - id: OPT-NEW
    name: New agency (ESSA)
    parent: DG DEFIS
    pros:
      - Clean mandate
      - Purpose-built staff
    cons:
      - Longer stand-up time
      - New institutional overhead

  - id: OPT-EASA
    name: EASA extension ("EASA-Space Transportation")
    parent: EASA
    pros:
      - Fastest lifecycle/AMC/GM culture deployment
      - Existing institutional infrastructure
    cons:
      - Mandate expansion politically heavy
      - Risk of aviation-centric bias

  - id: OPT-HYBRID
    name: Hybrid (EASA + ESSA split)
    parent: DG DEFIS / EASA
    split:
      easa_handles:
        - Crew licensing and training
        - ATM interfaces
      essa_handles:
        - Launch/re-entry licensing
        - Continued airworthiness for reusables
    pros:
      - Minimises duplication
      - Dedicated transport authority
    cons:
      - Coordination overhead between agencies
    recommendation: >
      If the EU Space Act proceeds with authorisation/registration/supervision
      at EU level, the hybrid option often minimises duplication while still
      creating a dedicated transport authority.

      gap: No dedicated EU-level HAO/space-transport regime in force

    - name: ESA
      role: Technology/programme development and investment
      gap: Technical agency, not a regulator
