## Core Principle

> One AMPEL360 kernel.
> Q100 = EASA lifecycle profile.
> Safety-first invariant unchanged.

Q100 **tightens** the AMPEL360 baseline for the EASA regulatory domain. It cannot weaken any ESSA constitutional invariant.

---

## 1. Domain Scope

**Platform:** Civil hydrogen aircraft, approximately 100 passengers.

**H-factor:** Passenger and crew safety envelope — defined by CS 25.1309 failure probability thresholds and the approved FHA/PSSA/SSA decomposition.

**Security role:** Artefact integrity + DOA governance (non-repudiable authority chain over all design and operational artefacts).

---

## 2. Regulatory Alignment

| Framework | Q100 Application |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **CS-25 / Part-25** | Primary airworthiness standard — all `H_REQ` derived from CS-25 compliance matrix |
| **Part-21** | Design Organisation Approval (DOA) — `H_SIGNOFF` authority chain |
| **CS-ETSO** | Equipment standards (if applicable) — bound as `H_CONSTRAINT` |
| **DO-178C** | Software assurance — software artefacts registered as `H_EVIDENCE` |
| **DO-254** | Hardware assurance — hardware artefacts registered as `H_EVIDENCE` |
| **AMC** | EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance — methods validated at P040 |
| **Part-M / Part-145** | Continued Airworthiness — ICA compliance as `H_UPDATE` trigger |

---

## 3. Phase-by-Phase Profile

### P010–P020 — Concept and Architecture

- **Top-Level Aircraft Requirements (TLAR)** → CS-25 derived compliance matrix tokenised as `H_REQ`
- **Safety envelope** aligned with CS 25.1309 failure probability philosophy
- **Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA)** → hazard items tokenised as `H_HAZARD`
- **Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA)** → constraints tokenised as `H_CONSTRAINT`
- **System Safety Assessment (SSA)** linkage established at P020 gate

### P030 — Industrial Chain

- Supply-chain `H_CONSTRAINT` binding for hydrogen-specific components
- ESG evidence anchored to `H_EVIDENCE` (novel propulsion supply chain)
- MCSC-ETH-01 mandatory for ethical sourcing declarations

### P040 — Engineering

- Methods aligned to EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC)
- Tool qualification where required (DO-178C, DO-254) — tool status as `H_CONSTRAINT`
- DMU/PMU as `H_EVIDENCE` — structural integrity and fuel system models
- PSSA/SSA decomposition traced to design artefacts

### P050 — Authority and Compliance

- DOA sign-off logic (`H_SIGNOFF`) — individual authority per CS-25 subpart
- Compliance demonstration matrix: each requirement → `H_EVIDENCE` → `H_SIGNOFF`
- MCSC-ACC-02 mandatory: authority record non-repudiation

### P060 — Integration

- Cross-chain coherence: H-tokens from industrial + engineering chains linked
- Hydrogen-specific integration evidence (fuel cell, structural, thermal) as `H_EVIDENCE`

### P070 — Test

- **Flight test campaign structuring** — each test point as `H_EVIDENCE` item
- Compliance demonstration mapping: test results → CS-25 showing tables
- Special conditions (if hydrogen-specific) — `H_EXCEPTION` with DOA-signed rollback
- `H_SIGNOFF` per test campaign phase

### P080 — Operations

- **ICA (Instructions for Continued Airworthiness)** generation — registered as `H_EVIDENCE`
- **Continued Airworthiness** lifecycle: occurrence classification → `H_UPDATE` if safety-relevant
- **Occurrence reporting loops** → Part-M occurrence reports → `H_UPDATE` → `H_ENVELOPE` re-evaluation
- MCSC-ACC-03 mandatory: operator audit trail

### P090 — Mission

- Mission control envelope: hydrogen range, payload, weather limits — bound in `H_ENVELOPE`
- Traffic/range/mission control parameters as operational `H_CONSTRAINT`
- Safety-relevant mission deviations → `H_UPDATE`

### P100 — Reporting

- Consolidated airworthiness evidence
- SII scoring including CS-25 compliance coverage
- All `H_SIGNOFF` by designated engineering authorities confirmed

### P120 — Baseline Update

- Baseline increment: STC / change package — CS-25 change classification
- MCSC-RES-* mandatory: configuration management integrity
- `H_ENVELOPE` version increment with DOA authority sign-off

## 4. Gate Invariant (Q100 Specialisation)

The AMPEL360 formal gate invariant applies with Q100-specific conditions:

```
AMPEL360-Q100(L) = {
  ∀ phase pᵢ ∈ L:
    Tokens(pᵢ) ⊆ Valid(H_CS25)          -- CS-25-derived envelope
    ∧ MCSC(pᵢ) ⊆ S                       -- security invariant
    ∧ Complete(T, pᵢ)                    -- no orphaned tokens
    ∧ Signed(H_SIGNOFF, DOA, pᵢ)        -- DOA authority confirmed
    ∧ CS25_Compliance(pᵢ) = DEMONSTRATED -- showing tables complete
}
```

**Q100 rule:** any design artefact without a complete `H_REQ → H_EVIDENCE → H_SIGNOFF` chain traceable to a CS-25 subpart **SHALL NOT** be activated.

## 5. What Q100 Is Not

| Not | Is |
|-----|-----|
| A substitute for DOA procedures | The lifecycle governance layer over DOA procedures |
| An EASA certification tool | The method that produces ALPC-ready compliance bundles for EASA |
| A flight operations system | The engineering lifecycle engine that produces ICA and operational envelopes |

---

## 6. Relationship to AMPEL360 and Constitutional Instruments

| Instrument | Q100 Role |
|------------|-----------|
| **ESSA-DOC-AMPEL360-001** | Q100 is a domain profile; inherits all five core responsibilities unchanged |
| **ESSA-CONST-001** | Q100 satisfies CI-001–CI-007 within the EASA regulatory context |
| **ESSA-DOC-H-001** | Q100 maps all eight H-tokens to CS-25 / Part-21 / Part-M artefact types |
| **ESSA-DOC-SF-001** | Q100 enforces SF-RULE-01 through SF-RULE-06 within EASA domain |
| **ESSA-STD-CCTLS-001** | Q100 phase coverage = P000–P120 with EASA-specific gate conditions |
