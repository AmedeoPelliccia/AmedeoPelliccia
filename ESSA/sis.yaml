description: >
  Formal definition of the Structural Integration State (SIS): the condition in
  which architecture, governance, safety mission, and security invariants are
  coherently embedded into institutional execution under ESSA. Defines the seven
  conditions, five components, priority ordering, and Structural Integration
  Index (SII) measurement dimensions.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Constitutional Declaration
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
constitutional_declaration: >
  A Structural Integration State is achieved when Safety-driven mission, Security
  governance invariants, and Lifecycle execution operate coherently within a
  unified architectural graph under ESSA.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 1. Definition
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
definition:
  term: Structural Integration State
  acronym: SIS
  type: structural_condition_of_systemic_coherence
  not: traditional_political_state
  applies_to:
    - constitutional_digital_substrate: ESSA-Architecture
    - institutional_mission_and_governance: ESSA-Agency
    - domain_execution_authorities: [EUSSA, sector_agencies]
  achieved_when: >
    All three tiers operate under a unified safety-driven lifecycle graph with
    shared invariants, baselines, and evidence.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 2. Stack Position
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
stack_position:
  tier_1: European Sovereign Systems Architecture (ESSA-Architecture)
  tier_2: European Safety and Security Agency (ESSA-Agency)
  tier_3: Sector Agencies (Space, Aviation, RSP, Autonomy)
  alignment_requirements:
    - safety_as_mission: Safety envelopes are first-class generative artefacts
    - security_as_governance: Security invariants protect the safety mission
    - deterministic_lifecycle: INTERPRET → CONFIRM → ACTIVATE → PUBLISH gates
    - agentic_bounded_generation: All generated candidates bounded by Safety Envelope

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 3. Seven Conditions for SIS
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
sis_conditions:
  - id: SIS-C-001
    name: Safety Envelope Generation
    description: Safety envelopes derive requirements
  - id: SIS-C-002
    name: Bounded Design
    description: Requirements constrain the design space within safety bounds
  - id: SIS-C-003
    name: Integrity Governance
    description: Security protects the integrity of the safety process
  - id: SIS-C-004
    name: Invariant Certification
    description: Certification validates safety invariants, not narrative conformance
  - id: SIS-C-005
    name: Operational Feedback
    description: Operation retrofeeds safety evidence into the lifecycle graph
  - id: SIS-C-006
    name: Traced Authority
    description: Authority is traced, bound, and auditable at every gate
  - id: SIS-C-007
    name: Federated Interoperability
    description: Cross-domain interoperability is structural, not ad-hoc
  note: SIS is transversal coherence, not vertical hierarchy

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 4. Five Components of SIS
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
sis_components:
  - id: SIS-COMP-A
    name: Ontological Integration
    description: >
      A single model of artefacts, states, and tokens (CCTLS token graph)
      governs all lifecycle activity across all tiers and domains.
    requires: ESSA-STD-CCTLS-001
  - id: SIS-COMP-B
    name: Normative Integration
    description: >
      A minimum common set of invariants (EU-SECURITY MCSC) applies uniformly
      across all sector agencies and profiles. Profiles may tighten, not weaken.
    requires: EU-SECURITY-MCSC
  - id: SIS-COMP-C
    name: Operational Integration
    description: >
      The CONFIRM → ACTIVATE gate sequence is applied uniformly across all
      lifecycle transitions. No transition is activated without S-preservation
      evidence.
    requires: ESSA-STD-CCTLS-001
  - id: SIS-COMP-D
    name: Ethical Integration
    description: >
      Safety-First Doctrine applies without exception.
      Priority ordering: Safety > Security > Performance.
    requires: ESSA-DOC-SF-001
  - id: SIS-COMP-E
    name: Technological Integration
    description: >
      LCOS runtime and ALPC conformance engine are the technological enablers.
      LCOS executes lifecycle state transitions and ledger. ALPC validates
      conformance (S-preservation, evidence sufficiency, baseline integrity).
    requires: [LCOS, ALPC]

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 5. What SIS Is Not
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
sis_exclusions:
  - Absolute centralisation
  - Militarisation
  - Super-agency with political command authority
  - Political control or sovereignty over national agencies
sis_positive_definition: >
  Structural coherence between mission, governance, and execution — enabling
  safety-driven, deterministic, interoperable, and ethically bound lifecycle
  governance.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 6. SIS vs Fragmented Model
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
sis_vs_fragmented:
  fragmented_model:
    - Regulation: Agency A regulates in isolation
    - Certification: Agency B certifies independently
    - Design: Industry designs without shared bounds
    - Security: Security layer superimposed post-hoc
    - Sustainability: Reported in separate silos
    - Interoperability: Ad-hoc bilateral agreements
    - Ethics: External policy layer
  structural_integration_state:
    - Regulation: All operate on a shared lifecycle graph
    - Certification: ALPC validates invariants deterministically
    - Design: Bounded synthesis inside Safety Envelope
    - Security: Invariants embedded in lifecycle gates
    - Sustainability: Measurable on the shared evidence graph
    - Interoperability: Structural — shared baselines and attestations
    - Ethics: Executable constraints in the lifecycle graph

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 7. Safety-Driven Priority Ordering
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
priority_ordering:
  rule: "Safety > Security > Performance"
  constraints:
    - security_cannot_override_safety: true
    - performance_cannot_weaken_safety_envelope: true
    - innovation_must_occur_inside_safety_envelope: true
  constitutional_rule: >
    Security ensures the mission is never corrupted. Security never redefines it.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 8. Structural Integration Index (SII)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
structural_integration_index:
  description: >
    A composite indicator derived from the lifecycle graph measuring the degree
    of structural integration achieved across five dimensions.
  dimensions:
    - id: SII-D1
      name: Ontological
      measurement: >
        Percentage of lifecycle artefacts tokenised under the common schema
    - id: SII-D2
      name: Normative
      measurement: >
        Percentage of active invariants with MCSC coverage
    - id: SII-D3
      name: Operational
      measurement: >
        Percentage of gate transitions with complete evidence chain
    - id: SII-D4
      name: Ethical
      measurement: >
        Percentage of design candidates that are envelope-bounded
    - id: SII-D5
      name: Technological
      measurement: >
        Percentage of certification outputs that are machine-verifiable
  full_sis_condition: >
    All five dimensions above constitutional minimum threshold (to be defined
    per domain profile).

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# 9. Strategic Implications
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
strategic_implications:
  - Regulation becomes anticipatory, not reactive
  - Certification is deterministic, not narrative
  - Interoperability is structural, not negotiated
  - Ethics is verifiable by computation
  - Sovereignty is technical, not declarative
  assertion: >
    A Structural Integration State is the condition under which ESSA-Agency can
    credibly assert: we govern by structure, not by assertion.
