# European Union Space Safety Agency (ESSA)

*A foundational concept to close Europe's civil space-transport regulatory gaps (training, reusable maintenance, sustainability constraints, operator registry, etc.).*

---

## 1. Problem Statement: What's Missing Today

Europe has **strong capability builders** (ESA, national agencies) and **strong space programme operators** (EU Space Programme / EUSPA), but **no single, specialised EU-level civil regulator for space transportation** end-to-end (launch → re-entry → reuse → continued airworthiness → crew licensing → operator oversight). ESA itself explicitly positions as a *technical* agency rather than a regulator.

At the same time, the European Commission has moved toward an EU-level rulebook via the **EU Space Act (proposal launched 25 June 2025)**, structured around **safety, resilience/cybersecurity, and sustainability** (including debris mitigation and environmental considerations).
The proposal is widely framed as addressing **fragmentation across Member States** and introducing EU-level **authorisation/registration/supervision** concepts.

**Gap:** the EU Space Act is fundamentally a *horizontal* framework for space activities/services; civil **space transportation** needs a *vertical* regulator with aviation-grade lifecycle oversight (training + maintenance + operations + incident reporting + configuration control) that can produce enforceable implementing rules and means of compliance.

---

## 2. Mission and Scope of ESSA

**Mission:** Ensure **safe, resilient, and sustainable** civil space transportation in Europe, with **harmonised licensing and oversight** for operators and reusable platforms, and full integration with European airspace and space-traffic-management regimes.

**Regulated domain (civil):**

- **Launch and re-entry operations** from European territory and/or by EU-established operators (including operations abroad by EU operators, via extraterritorial licensing hooks, if politically chosen).
- **Reusable space platforms** (RLVs/spaceplanes/reusable stages) and their **continued airworthiness / maintenance systems**.
- **Spaceports/ranges** (ground safety, hazardous operations, interface with aviation ATM/UTM).
- **Crew licensing + training organisations** (professional crew) and **participant safety/training** (spaceflight participants).
- **Operator registry and supervision**, occurrence reporting, safety management systems (SMS), and compliance audits.
- **Sustainability constraints** for transport operations (debris prevention during ascent/re-entry, controlled disposal, environmental footprint reporting where applicable).

**Explicit exclusions (recommended):**

- Military space operations (remain national/EU defence frameworks).
- Pure satellite service provision not tied to transport (covered by EU Space Act horizontal regime + other bodies).

---

## 3. Institutional Mapping: What Exists, What ESSA Adds

**EUSPA (today):** implements the EU Space Programme and associated security/exploitation roles (e.g., Galileo/EGNOS, Copernicus user uptake, GOVSATCOM/IRIS², EU SST front desk). It is not structured as a transport safety regulator.

**EASA (today):** aviation regulator; already touches "higher airspace operations" discussions and issues safety notices linked to uncontrolled re-entries, but there is **no dedicated EU-level HAO/space-transport regime in force**.

**ESA (today):** technology/programme development and investment (including reusability initiatives), not a regulator.

**ESSA adds (proposed):** the missing **competent authority for civil space transportation**, capable of:

- issuing **operator licences** and **vehicle/platform approvals**;
- enforcing **continued airworthiness** for reusable systems;
- certifying **training organisations** and licensing **crew**;
- operating a unified **EU civil space transport operator registry**;
- running **oversight, audits, occurrence reporting**, and safety data analysis.

---

## 4. Regulatory Architecture (Pragmatic EU Design)

### 4.1. Legal Basis

- **Basic Regulation** establishing ESSA as an EU Agency, with implementing powers aligned to:

  - EU Space Act obligations (safety/resilience/sustainability) for transport operators;
  - airspace integration frameworks (Eurocontrol/SES, EASA interoperability interfaces), by delegation or joint rulemaking.

### 4.2. "Performance-Based" Licensing as the Core Pattern

Adopt a **performance-based** approach (safety objectives + acceptable means of compliance), similar in philosophy to modern launch/re-entry licensing regimes elsewhere (e.g., the FAA's consolidated Part 450 approach).
For Europe, this fits well with the established **AMC/GM** model used in aviation (predictable compliance pathways + flexibility for innovation).

---

## 5. The Missing Rulebooks ESSA Should Publish (Minimum Viable Set)

A workable structure is to publish implementing rules as **"Parts"** (aviation-style), plus AMC/GM:

| Domain | Proposed Part | What It Covers (Examples) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Operator licensing & SMS | **Part-STO** (Space Transportation Operator) | licence basis, SMS, safety case, financial responsibility/insurance, security baseline, reporting |
| Launch/re-entry safety | **Part-LRE** | trajectory safety, public risk criteria, flight safety system expectations, range coordination |
| Reusable platform approval | **Part-RSP** (Reusable Space Platform) | design approval basis for reuse-critical items, configuration control, life limits, refurbishment standards |
| Continued airworthiness | **Part-CAW-S** | CAMO-equivalent for space platforms, maintenance programme approval, reliability & trend monitoring |
| Maintenance organisations | **Part-MRO-S** | Part-145-like approvals for reuse refurbishment/overhaul, human factors, tooling, NDT standards |
| Spaceport/range licensing | **Part-SPP** | hazardous ops, propellant handling, emergency planning, interface with ATM/airspace closures |
| Crew licensing & training orgs | **Part-SCL / Part-STO-ORA** | crew categories, medical, recurrent training, training organisation approvals |
| Sustainability & debris | **Part-SUST** | debris mitigation plans, controlled disposal requirements, environmental footprint reporting hooks aligned to EU Space Act sustainability pillar |
| Cyber resilience | **Part-CYB-S** | baseline cybersecurity/risk assessment consistent with EU resilience pillar |

---

## 6. Operator Registry: What "Good" Looks Like

ESSA should operate a unified **EU Civil Space Transport Registry** with:

- **Operator ID**, licence scope, authorised vehicles/platforms, approved spaceports/ranges;
- **platform configuration baseline** + controlled changes (continued airworthiness concept);
- **occurrence reporting** and safety directives;
- linkage to **STM/SST services** (EU-level tracking/coordination obligations under EU Space Act's safety direction).

This is not just a database—it is the enforcement backbone that makes "authorisation / registration / supervision" real in daily operations (the direction that EU Space Act materials explicitly signal).

---

## 7. Reusable Platform Maintenance: The Key Regulatory Innovation

The single biggest "new" domain versus traditional space governance is **continued airworthiness for reusables**.

ESSA should require each reusable platform/operator to have:

- an approved **Maintenance Programme** (life limits, inspection intervals, refurbishment criteria);
- a **Configuration & Build Standard** regime (as-flown vs as-maintained reconciliation);
- mandatory **NDT/inspection qualification** for refurbishment shops;
- reliability programmes (trend monitoring, anomaly classification, recurring defect control);
- human factors + tool control requirements akin to aviation MRO.

This is the "Part-M ecosystem" for space transport—without it, reusable systems remain regulated like one-off rockets, which breaks economically and operationally.

---

## 8. Civil Training Procedures: Harmonise Before Traffic Scales

ESSA should define **crew categories** and training minima:

- **Space Transport Flight Crew** (professional): licensing, medical, proficiency checks.
- **Spaceflight Participants**: minimum training + informed consent rules + emergency preparedness.
- **Ground safety critical roles**: range safety officer, hazardous ops supervisor, mission director—competency frameworks + recurrent checks.

This aligns with the reality flagged in "higher airspace operations" roadmapping: EU needs dedicated regimes as operations emerge.

---

## 9. Sustainability Constraints: Make It Enforceable, Not Aspirational

The EU Space Act proposal foregrounds sustainability (debris mitigation and environmental aspects).
ESSA should convert that into transport-grade requirements:

- debris prevention during ascent/re-entry (fragmentation control, passivation, controlled disposal);
- re-entry casualty-risk governance and controlled corridors (with STM/ATM integration);
- environmental reporting for launches (local environmental impact + lifecycle accounting hooks where proportionate);
- incentives: "EU Space Label" style compliance marks can be operationalised through licence privileges.

---

## 10. Organisational Design (Lean but Complete)

**Directorates (minimal):**

1. **Rulemaking & Standards** (Parts + AMC/GM)
2. **Certification & Licensing** (operators, platforms, spaceports)
3. **Continued Airworthiness & Maintenance Oversight**
4. **Operations Oversight & Safety Data** (occurrence reporting, directives)
5. **Training & Human Factors**
6. **Sustainability & Debris Compliance**
7. **Registry & Digital Systems** (operator registry, configuration ledger, interfaces to STM/SST)
8. **International & Legal** (Outer Space Treaty state-responsibility coordination; cross-recognition)

---

## 11. Fast Implementation Roadmap (So It Doesn't Stall)

**Phase A (0–18 months):**

- Stand up the **registry** + interim "Part-STO Light" for operator authorisation.
- Start with **uncrewed** launch/re-entry + spaceport licensing + occurrence reporting.

**Phase B (18–36 months):**

- Introduce **Part-RSP / Part-CAW-S / Part-MRO-S** for reusable systems (the economic unlock).
- Formalise STM coordination requirements (EU Space Act safety pillar operationalised).

**Phase C (36–60 months):**

- Expand to **crewed** suborbital/point-to-point and full crew licensing regime.

---

## 12. Three Viable Institutional Options (Politically Realistic)

1. **New agency (ESSA)** under DG DEFIS: clean mandate, purpose-built staff.
2. **EASA extension ("EASA-Space Transportation")**: fastest to deploy lifecycle/AMC/GM culture, but mandate expansion is politically heavy.
3. **Hybrid**: EASA handles crew/training/ATM interfaces; ESSA handles launch/re-entry licensing + continued airworthiness for reusables.

If the EU Space Act proceeds with authorisation/registration/supervision at EU level, the **hybrid** often minimises duplication while still creating a dedicated transport authority.
