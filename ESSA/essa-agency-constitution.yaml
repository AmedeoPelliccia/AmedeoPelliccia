description: >
  Constitutional bridge instrument defining the European Safety and Security
  Agency (ESSA-Agency) as the institutional layer between the European Sovereign
  Systems Architecture (ESSA-Architecture) and European sector safety agencies.
  Establishes doctrine, mission-governance separation, agentic operating model,
  profile extensibility, governance kernel, ALPC certification mandate, and
  Structural Integration State (SIS) condition.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Minimal Charter Statement
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
charter_statement: >
  The European Safety and Security Agency (ESSA-Agency) is the institutional
  bridge between the European Sovereign Systems Architecture and European sector
  safety agencies. It operates under a Safety-First doctrine: advance in safety,
  protect in security. Safety defines the agentic mission and drives requirement
  derivation and design generation. Security provides governance invariants
  ensuring integrity, resilience, accountability, and controlled interoperability
  across all safety-critical lifecycle artefacts and transitions. ESSA-Agency is
  extensible by profiles and enforced through deterministic conformance gates and
  machine-verifiable certification.

mission_governance_separation:
  safety_mission:
    label: "Safety = Mission (Advance)"
    doctrine: advance_in_safety
    functions:
      - Define and maintain Safety Envelopes
      - Derive requirements from safety envelopes (safety-driven generation)
      - Validate safety evidence and operational readiness
      - Manage incidents, occurrences, and lessons learned
      - Coordinate cross-border safety continuity
      - Oversee autonomous system safety boundaries

    label: "Security = Governance (Protect)"
    doctrine: protect_in_security
    functions:
      - Integrity of artefacts, baselines, and audit trails
      - Authority binding, sign-off, non-repudiation

  non_negotiable_rule: >
    Security mechanisms cannot override safety obligations.
    Security exists to protect them.

# 3. Doctrine
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
doctrine:
  statement: "Advance in Safety, Protect in Security"
  operational_model:
    - stage: Generate
      doctrine_alignment: advance_in_safety
      action: Derive requirements from Safety Envelope inside safety bounds
    - stage: Design
      doctrine_alignment: advance_in_safety
      action: Bounded synthesis — valid design space D ⊆ Valid(S)
    - stage: Govern
      doctrine_alignment: protect_in_security
      action: Security invariants protect S from corruption or circumvention
    - stage: Certify
      doctrine_alignment: advance_in_safety
      action: Invariant validation over the lifecycle graph — not narrative

# 4. Agentic and Extensible Operating Model
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
agentic_operating_model:
  pipeline_description: >
    ESSA-Agency operates an agentic pipeline where Safety Envelopes are
    first-class artefacts, requirements are derived from safety envelopes,
    design candidates are generated only within validated safety bounds, and any
    candidate outside the envelope is non-activable by construction.
  pipeline_properties:
    - safety_envelopes_are_first_class_artefacts: true
    - requirements_derived_from_safety_envelopes: true
    - design_bounded_by_validated_safety: true
    - out_of_envelope_candidates_non_activable: true

  profiles:
    extensibility_rule: >
      Profiles may tighten controls. They cannot weaken the minimum
      constitutional baseline.

      Achieving coherence across architecture, governance, safety mission, and
      security invariants constitutes a Structural Integration State (SIS).
