    evaluation_subsection: Objectives & Ambition
    status: draft
    description: >
      Defines the project vision, scientific and technological objectives,
      measurable ambition targets, and alignment with EuroHPC JU strategic
      priorities and the IDEALE-ESG framework.

      vision: >
        AI-BOOST aims to establish a European-sovereign, certification-grade
        AI framework that couples frontier large-scale models with
        high-performance computing infrastructure to accelerate simulation,
        testing, and validation workflows across aerospace, energy, and
        defence domains — under full governance, traceability, and
        environmental accountability.
      objectives:
        - id: OBJ-01
          label: Deterministic AI Governance at HPC Scale
          description: >
            Deliver a deterministic AI governance pipeline (PATH → MTL)
            that operates natively on EuroHPC infrastructure, ensuring
            every AI model, dataset, and inference result is traceable,
            gated, and auditable — from training through deployment.
          kpi: "100 % of AI artefacts gate-validated before operational use"
          alignment:
            - IDEALE pillar: Information (data sovereignty)
            - IDEALE pillar: Governance (deterministic pipelines)

        - id: OBJ-02
          label: Frontier Simulation Acceleration
          description: >
            Achieve order-of-magnitude acceleration of multi-physics
            simulation workflows (CFD, FEM, coupled aero-thermal-structural)
            by integrating AI surrogate models trained and validated on
            EuroHPC pre-exascale and exascale systems.
          kpi: "≥ 10× speed-up vs. baseline full-fidelity simulation"
          alignment:
            - IDEALE pillar: Aerospace (certification-grade engineering)
            - IDEALE pillar: Energy (hydrogen system simulation)

        - id: OBJ-03
          label: Certification-Grade AI for Safety-Critical Domains
          description: >
            Develop and demonstrate AI model qualification pathways
            compatible with EASA CS-25 / Part 21 and emerging EU AI Act
            requirements, producing evidence packages that satisfy
            mixed-boundary simplex admissibility (simplex-contract.yaml).
          kpi: "≥ 3 AI models qualified through evidence-gated pipeline"
          alignment:
            - IDEALE pillar: Aerospace (certification)
            - IDEALE pillar: Defence (dual-use awareness)
            - AMPEL360 simplex classification

        - id: OBJ-04
          label: Sovereign European AI–HPC Integration
          description: >
            Ensure all training, inference, and data pipelines run on
            European HPC infrastructure with no dependency on
            extra-European cloud providers for safety-critical workloads,
            aligned with EU data sovereignty and export-control
            requirements.
          kpi: "100 % of safety-critical workloads on EuroHPC nodes"
          alignment:
            - IDEALE pillar: Information (data sovereignty)
            - IDEALE pillar: Defence (export control)
            - EuroHPC JU objective: strategic autonomy

        - id: OBJ-05
          label: Sustainability-Aware HPC Utilisation
          description: >
            Integrate environmental footprint tracking (energy consumption,
            carbon intensity) into every HPC job, enabling lifecycle
            assessment of AI model training and inference aligned with
            Digital Product Passport and ESG reporting requirements.
          kpi: "CO₂-per-inference metric tracked for all production models"
          alignment:
            - ESG constraint: Environment (LC14 circularity, DPP)
            - IDEALE pillar: Energy (renewable integration)

      ambition: >
        AI-BOOST goes beyond incremental improvement. It targets structural
        integration of AI governance, HPC infrastructure, and certification
        workflows into a single, auditable, European-sovereign pipeline.
        The ambition is not merely to use HPC for AI — but to make
        AI-on-HPC certification-grade, traceable, and environmentally
        accountable. No existing European project combines deterministic
        governance (PATH → MTL), mixed-boundary admissibility
        (simplex-contract), and frontier HPC at this integration depth.

      novelty:
        - Deterministic AI governance pipeline native to EuroHPC
        - Mixed-boundary simplex classification applied to AI model qualification
        - Capillary Merit Index (CMI) for contributor attribution in HPC-scale projects
        - Sustainability tracking integrated at the HPC job level

      eurohpc_alignment:
        - EuroHPC JU strategic priority: European AI sovereignty
        - EuroHPC JU strategic priority: Industrial uptake of HPC
        - EuroHPC JU strategic priority: Skills and talent development
