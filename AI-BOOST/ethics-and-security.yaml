        pseudonymised, or excluded.
      references:
        - "GDPR Art. 5, 25"

    - id: ETH-04
      principle: Transparency

        Model architectures, training data sources, and evaluation results
        are publicly documented.

    - id: ETH-05
      principle: Diversity, Non-Discrimination, and Fairness

        Multilingual training ensures balanced performance across all
        24 EU official languages; bias audits are conducted per work package.

    - id: ETH-06
      principle: Societal and Environmental Well-Being

    - id: ETH-07
      principle: Accountability

        All AI artefacts are traceable through the PATH → MTL governance
        pipeline with immutable audit trails.

  eu_ai_act_classification:
    - category: General-Purpose AI (GPAI)
      applicable: true
      justification: >
        Training compute exceeds GPAI threshold; open-weights release
        triggers GPAI provider obligations.

    - category: High-Risk AI System
      applicable: domain_dependent
      justification: >
        High-risk when deployed in aerospace certification (Annex III).
        Simplex-contract evidence gating satisfies conformity assessment
        requirements.

    - category: Prohibited AI Practices
      applicable: false
      justification: >
        No social scoring, real-time biometric identification,
        or manipulation techniques.

        Multilingual NLP could be repurposed for mass surveillance.
      likelihood: low
