# AI-BOOST — Application Strategy

*AI-Based Optimisation of Operational Simulation and Testing*

**Call:** Frontier AI Grand Challenge · EuroHPC JU · GA 101135737
**Deadline:** 2026-04-13
**Machine-readable spec:** [`application-strategy.yaml`](application-strategy.yaml)

---

## 1. Project Concept

AI-BOOST targets the structural integration of **frontier AI models**, **European HPC infrastructure**, and **certification-grade governance** into a single auditable pipeline — enabling simulation acceleration, AI model qualification, and sustainability tracking across aerospace, energy, and defence domains.

The project is anchored in the **IDEALE-ESG** framework (Information · Defense · Energy · Aerospace · Logistics · Economy | Environment · Social · Governance) and uses the **AMPEL360** certification architecture for deterministic gating, traceability, and mixed-boundary admissibility.

## 3. DEL-01 — Project Concept & Objectives (Excellence → Objectives & Ambition)

### 3.1 Vision

AI-BOOST aims to establish a European-sovereign, certification-grade AI framework that couples frontier large-scale models with high-performance computing infrastructure to accelerate simulation, testing, and validation workflows across aerospace, energy, and defence domains — under full governance, traceability, and environmental accountability.

### 3.2 Objectives

| ID | Objective | KPI |
|----|-----------|-----|
| OBJ-01 | Deterministic AI Governance at HPC Scale | 100 % of AI artefacts gate-validated before operational use |
| OBJ-02 | Frontier Simulation Acceleration | ≥ 10× speed-up vs. baseline full-fidelity simulation |
| OBJ-03 | Certification-Grade AI for Safety-Critical Domains | ≥ 3 AI models qualified through evidence-gated pipeline |
| OBJ-04 | Sovereign European AI–HPC Integration | 100 % of safety-critical workloads on EuroHPC nodes |
| OBJ-05 | Sustainability-Aware HPC Utilisation | CO₂-per-inference metric tracked for all production models |

### 3.3 Ambition & Novelty

AI-BOOST goes beyond incremental improvement. It targets structural integration of AI governance, HPC infrastructure, and certification workflows into a single, auditable, European-sovereign pipeline. The ambition is not merely to use HPC for AI — but to make AI-on-HPC certification-grade, traceable, and environmentally accountable.

**Novel elements:**
- Deterministic AI governance pipeline (PATH → MTL) native to EuroHPC
- Mixed-boundary simplex classification applied to AI model qualification
- Capillary Merit Index (CMI) for contributor attribution in HPC-scale projects
- Sustainability tracking integrated at the HPC job level

### 3.4 EuroHPC JU Alignment

- European AI sovereignty
- Industrial uptake of HPC
- Skills and talent development
- Frontier AI Grand Challenge scope: large-scale AI models on pre-exascale/exascale systems
